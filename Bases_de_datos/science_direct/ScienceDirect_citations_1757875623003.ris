AB  - In light of the rapid and unpredictable developments in artificial intelligence (AI), there is a growing need for innovative marketing strategies that can expand market reach and effectively promote services. AI and social interaction have emerged as powerful tools in modern marketing, particularly through the use of social media platforms to enhance product awareness and drive customer engagement. This study investigates the factors influencing customer decision-making in relation to participation in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI)-based marketing. Drawing on prior research in the field, the study introduces a conceptual model incorporating key variables such as age, Internet usage, information quality, and information credibility. To examine the proposed model, a questionnaire was administered to students from universities in Tehran. The collected data were analyzed using appropriate statistical methods. The findings reveal that customer satisfaction and customer inertia significantly influence customer decisions to engage in smart marketing practices. Among the evaluated variables, information quality was identified as the most impactful factor, while Internet usage had the least influence. These results provide practical insights for marketers and researchers aiming to leverage GAI in customer-oriented strategies.

AB  - Objectives
Artificial intelligence (AI) is widely used in healthcare for various purposes, with generative AI (GAI) increasingly being applied to systematic review (SR) processes. We aimed to summarize the evidence on the performance metrics of GAI in the SR process.
Methods
PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global were searched from their inception up to March 2025. Only experimental studies that compared GAI with other GAIs or human reviewers at any stage of the SR were included. Modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies version 2 was used to assess the quality of the studies that used GAI in the study selection process. We summarized the findings of the included studies using a narrative approach.
Results
Out of 7418 records screened, 30 studies were included. These studies used GAI tools such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Microsoft Bing AI. GAI appears to be effective for participant, intervention, comparator, and outcome formulation and data extraction processes, including complex information. However, because of inconsistent reliability, GAI is not recommended for literature search and study selection as it may retrieve nonrelevant articles and yield inconsistent results. There was mixed evidence on whether GAI can be used for risk of bias assessment. Studies using GAI for study selection were generally of high quality based on the modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies version 2.
Conclusions
GAI shows promising support in participant, intervention, comparator, and outcome-based question formulation and data extraction. Although it holds potential to enhance the SR process in healthcare, further practical application and validated evidence are needed before it can be fully integrated into standard workflows.

AB  - To date, studies on the relationship between generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) dependence and service innovation have yielded inconsistent results. Drawing on self-regulation theory, we examine how and when GenAI dependence promotes or inhibits service innovation in the hospitality industry. Three studies were conducted to examine how GenAI is used in hospitality management and test the conceptual model: a three-wave questionnaire survey (N = 333), a quasi-field experiment (N = 227), and an in-depth interview (N = 11). The results indicate that GenAI dependence promotes service innovation by decreasing affective rumination, and this beneficial indirect path is amplified by employees’ neuroticism. Meanwhile, GenAI dependence inhibits service innovation by decreasing problem-solving pondering, and this unfavourable indirect path is weakened by employees’ conscientiousness. This exploration of when and how the use of GenAI either promotes or inhibits service innovation broadens our understanding of the consequences of GenAI dependence in the hospitality management field.

AB  - Summary
The mRNA-based therapeutics, notably mRNA vaccines, represent a new era of powerful tools to combat various diseases. However, the relatively low translation efficiency of exogenous mRNA often limits its wide application. Here, we propose a computational framework called UTailoR (UTR tailor), which significantly improves the challenge by optimizing 5' UTR sequences based on a two-step artificial intelligence strategy. We first develop a deep-learning-based discriminative model for predicting mRNA translation efficiency with 5' UTR sequences, and then present a generative model to generate optimized 5' UTR sequences, which are designed to be highly close to the original sequences but predicted to result in high translation efficiency. The experimental results show that the UTailoR-optimized sequences outstrip the corresponding original sequences by ∼ 200%. This work provides an efficient and convenient method for the mRNA 5' UTR optimization, which can be easily accessed at http://www.cuilab.cn/utailor.

AB  - The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools has presented both opportunities and challenges in English as an Additional Language (EAL) writing education. This mixed-methods exploratory study investigated how Chinese EAL students perceived and used GenAI, and how these attitudes and behaviors reflected their Critical Language Awareness (CLA). Survey data were collected from 320 Chinese undergraduate and graduate students studying in China and abroad, supplemented by in-depth semi-structured interviews with five volunteers. Quantitative findings revealed that, while participants valued GenAI for reducing language barriers and enhancing writing mechanics, they remained wary of issues related to originality, transparency, and ethical accountability. Qualitative analysis further illuminated participants' emerging CLA, evident in their negotiations of power (managing overreliance and misinformation), ideology (navigating dominant academic norms), and social justice (acknowledging cultural biases encoded in GenAI training data). Although students were primarily motivated by pragmatic benefits, such as improved grammar, structure, and efficiency, they also recognized GenAI's potential to perpetuate monolingual, Western-centric perspectives. These results underscore the need to embed CLA principles in GenAI-assisted pedagogy. By encouraging students to critically interrogate GenAI outputs, question linguistic hierarchies, and reflect on sociocultural contexts, educators can better leverage GenAI's affordances while fostering ethical, culturally responsive, and equitable writing practices.

AB  - The pace of artificial intelligence (AI) integration into health care has accelerated with rapid advances in generative AI (genAI). Gastroenterology and hepatology in particular will be transformed due to the multimodal workflows that integrate endoscopic video, radiologic imaging, tabular data, and unstructured note text. GenAI will impact the entire spectrum of clinical experience, from administrative tasks, diagnostic guidance, and treatment recommendations. Unlike traditional machine learning approaches, genAI is more flexible, with one platform able to be used across multiple tasks. Initial evidence suggests benefits in lower-level administrative tasks, such as clinical documentation, medical billing, and scheduling; and information tasks, such as patient education and summarization of the medical literature. No evidence exists for genAI solutions for more complex tasks relevant to clinical care, such as clinical reasoning for diagnostic and treatment decisions that may affect patient outcomes. Challenges of output reliability, data privacy, and useful integration remain; potential solutions include robust validation, regulatory oversight, and "human–AI teaming" strategies to ensure safe, effective deployment. We remain optimistic in the potential of genAI to augment clinical expertise due to the adaptability of genAI to handle multiple data modalities to obtain and focus relevant information flows and the human-friendly interfaces that facilitate ease of use. We believe that the potential of genAI for dynamic human-algorithmic interactions may allow for a degree of clinician-directed customization to enhance human presence.

Nurses’ clinical research activities have contributed to optimizing the care process and improving patient outcomes, and generative artificial intelligence (GAI) may help clinical nurses strengthen their research skills. To support research, this study aimed to explore the Chinese nurses’ perceptions and experiences of GAI training.
Methods
This study used a descriptive qualitative design. The China Nurses Network conducted a three-day training session on “GAI for Nursing Research” theme, we selected 23 nurses by a convenience sampling method among participating in the training. The researchers conducted three focus group interviews at the end of each day. All focus groups were interviewed face-to-face to facilitate interaction, data collection, and observation. The data were analyzed using conventional content analysis and coded manually.
Results
The results showed that nurses’ use of GAI to support scientific research was dynamic and characterized by evolving perceptions and practices. Four themes and 11 sub-themes emerged from the analysis: 1) utilization efficacy: cope with research ability, affected by many factors; 2) booster research: growth and challenges go hand in hand; 3) role reversal: from GAI-dominated to nurse-dominated; 4) beautiful dream: more features on research, more assistants on clinical care.
Conclusions
The effectiveness of GAI in supporting clinical nurses in conducting research is mainly limited by differences in personal research literacy, lack of ethical regulation, and information accuracy. In the future, it is necessary to improve nurses’ relevant skills through specialized training and promote the standardization of technical regulations to ensure the appropriate application of GAI in nursing research.

AB  - With the rapid development of renewable energy and electric vehicles, batteries, as the core components of electrochemical energy storage systems, have become a global focus in both scientific research and industrial sectors due to their critical impact on system efficiency and safety. However, the complex multi-physics reactions within batteries make traditional mathematical models inadequate for comprehensively revealing their mechanisms. The key to solving this problem lies in introducing data-driven approaches, which have laid a solid foundation for battery research and development through extensive accumulation of experimental data and extraction of effective information. Generative artificial intelligence (GAI), leveraging its powerful latent pattern learning and data generation capabilities, has already found widespread applications in protein structure prediction, material inverse design, and data augmentation, demonstrating its broad application prospects. Applying GAI to battery research workflows with diverse battery data resources could provide innovative solutions to challenges in battery research. In this perspective, we introduce the core principles and latest advancements of generative models (GMs), including Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), and Diffusion Model (DM), which can learn the latent distribution of the input samples to generate new data by sampling from it. Applications of GAI in battery research are then reviewed. For battery materials design, by learning material compositions, structures, and properties, GM can generate novel candidate materials with desired properties through conditional constraints, significantly extending the chemical space to be explored. For electrode microstructure characterization, GM can serve as a bridge for interconversion and integration of different image data, enhance the quality of microscopic characterization, and generate realistic synthetic data. For battery state estimation, GM can perform data augmentation and feature extraction on battery datasets, which benefits the model performance for battery state estimation. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future development directions in terms of data governance and model design, including data quality and diversity, data standardization and sharing, usability of synthetic data, interpretability of GM, and foundational models for battery research. For the innovation and advancement of battery technology, this perspective offers theoretical references and practical guidelines for implementing GAI as an effective tool in battery research workflows by discussing its status and prospects in this field.

AB  - In a radiation oncology clinic, machine downtime can be a serious burden to the entire department. This study investigates using increasingly popular generative artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to assist medical physicists in troubleshooting linear accelerator issues. Google's NotebookLM, supplemented with background information on linear accelerator issues/solutions, was used as a machine troubleshooting assistant for this purpose. Two board-certified medical physicists evaluated the large language model's responses based on hallucination, relevancy, correctness, and completeness. Results indicated that responses improved with increasing source data context and more specific prompt construction. Keeping risk mitigation and the inherent limitations of AI in mind, this work offers a viable, low-risk method to improve efficiency in radiation oncology. This work uses a “Machine Troubleshooting Assistance” application to provide an adaptable example of how radiation oncology clinics can begin using generative AI to enhance clinical efficiency.

AB  - Purpose
The integration of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) into scientific research and academic writing has generated considerable controversy. Currently, standards for using GAI in academic medicine remain undefined. This study aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the guidance provided for authors regarding the use of GAI in ophthalmology scientific journals.
Design
Cross-sectional bibliometric analysis.
Participants
A total of 140 ophthalmology journals listed in the Scimago Journal and Country Rankings, regardless of language or origin.
Methods
We systematically searched and screened the 140 ophthalmology journals’ websites on October 19 and 20, 2024, and conducted updates on November 19 and 20, 2024.
Main Outcome Measures
The content of GAI guidelines from the websites of the 140 ophthalmology journals.
Results
Of 140 journals reviewed, 96 (69%) provide explicit guidelines for authors regarding the use of GAI. Among these, nearly all journals agree on 3 key points: (1) 94 journals (98%) have established specific guidelines prohibiting GAI from being listed as an author; (2) 94 journals (98%) emphasize that human authors are responsible for the outputs generated by GAI tools; and (3) all 96 journals require authors to disclose any use of GAI. In addition, 20 journals (21%) specify that their guidelines pertain solely to the writing process with GAI. Furthermore, 92 journals (66%) have developed guidelines concerning GAI-generated images, with 63 journals (68%) permitting their use and 29 (32%) prohibiting them. Among those that prohibit GAI images, 27 journals (93%) allow their use under specific conditions.
Conclusion
Although there is considerable ethical consensus among ophthalmology journals regarding the use of GAI, notable variations exist in terms of permissible use and disclosure practices. Establishing standardized guidelines is essential to safeguard the originality and integrity of scientific research. Researchers must uphold high standards of academic ethics and integrity when using GAI.

This study aimed to explore the effects of interactive teaching strategies based on generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) under the guidance of outcome-based education (OBE) theory on higher-order thinking skills (HOTS) and artificial intelligence (AI) literacy of undergraduate nursing students.
Background
Recently, GenAI-assisted teaching has been widely recognised as a trend in nursing education reform. HOTS and AI literacy are important for nursing students in the era of artificial intelligence. However, studies on the use of GenAI to enhance the HOTS and AI literacy of undergraduate nursing students are limited.
Design
A quasi-experimental study.
Methods
Based on OBE theory, interactive teaching strategies using GenAI were introduced into a nursing course. Overall, 132 third-year nursing undergraduates enrolled in this course were randomly divided into experimental (n = 66) and control groups (n = 66).
Results
After completing the course, the HOTS scores of nursing undergraduates (P = 0.018) and AI literacy (P < 0.001) in the experimental group were significantly better than those in the control group. There was a significant difference in the HOTS scores (P < 0.001) and AI literacy (P < 0.001) between the experimental group before and after the course.
Conclusion
GenAI-assisted teaching could help nursing undergraduates improve their HOTS and AI literacy. As an important auxiliary teaching tool, GenAI should be integrated into other nursing courses and widely applied in nursing education in the future.

AB  - Incorporating diversity, equity, and inclusivity often leads tourism brands to support stigmatized groups, yet tourists may perceive these groups negatively and avoid these brands. Drawing from one field study on the Facebook Ad platform and two experimental studies, we find that brand avoidance among tourists is reduced when tourism brands adopt AI-generated (vs. human-generated) moral content to support stigmatized dissociative out-groups. This effect is mediated by tourists' psychological proximity to these groups and is weakened for those with a strong sense of common fate with these out-groups. These insights contribute to tourism literature on generative AI and diversity, equity, and inclusivity while offering strategic guidance for brands seeking to embrace stigmatized groups.

AB  - The rapid expansion of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has transformed various industries, giving rise to an array of GAI products. However, inconsistent product quality complicates user decisions, jeopardizing both the sustainability of GAI technologies and their broader adoption. To address these challenges, this study proposes a user-centered evaluation framework that integrates fuzzy social networks with advanced multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) approaches. Grounded theory is first employed to establish a ''marketing-information-product-individual'' system of factors influencing GAI product adoption. Next, fuzzy social networks reduce semantic ambiguity and mitigate expert bias, while the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method uncovers causal relationships among these factors. The DEMATEL-based Analytic Network Process (DANP) then quantifies the relative importance of each factor, followed by a modified VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method to comprehensively evaluate representative GAI products. The findings reveal that product maturity exerts the strongest driving force, whereas perceived effect experiences the highest overall impact. Information reliability and the individual dimension carry the greatest weights. Moreover, current products display notable deficiencies in risk management, user service, and ease of use, all of which warrant developers' attention to enhance user satisfaction and adoption. In light of these results, the study proposes targeted optimization strategies for four distinct GAI products. By integrating fuzzy social networks and MADM methodologies, this framework offers a rigorous, systematic evaluation tool that significantly improves decision-making accuracy and promotes the sustainable development of GAI applications.

AB  - People are increasingly using generative artificial intelligence (AI) for emotional support, creating trust-based interactions with limited predictability and transparency. We address the fragmented nature of research on trust in AI through a multidisciplinary conceptual review, examining theoretical foundations for understanding trust in the emerging context of emotional support from generative AI. Through an in-depth literature search across human-computer interaction, computer-mediated communication, social psychology, mental health, economics, sociology, philosophy, and science and technology studies, we developed two principal contributions. First, we summarise relevant definitions of trust across disciplines. Second, based on our first contribution, we define trust in the context of emotional support provided by AI and present a categorisation of relevant concepts that recur across well-established research areas. Our work equips researchers with a map for navigating the literature and formulating hypotheses about AI-based mental health support, as well as important theoretical, methodological, and practical implications for advancing research in this area.

This study aimed to examine the usage, awareness, and satisfaction related to generative AI (GenAI) among undergraduate students at a Traditional Korean Medicine (TKM) college in Korea and to identify factors associated with GenAI use and satisfaction.
Methods
A structured questionnaire consisting of 56 items across six domains was administered, covering demographics, general and TKM-specific GenAI use, satisfaction, educational experiences, and future expectations. Descriptive statistics, univariable analysis, multivariable logistic regression, and correlation analysis were performed.
Results
A total of 234 students across six academic years participated in the survey. Most respondents were aware of GenAI (88.5 %) and used it for general purposes (79.9 %). However, only 16.2 % actively used it for TKM learning. While 70.4 % were satisfied with using GenAI in general, only 45.8 % felt satisfied with its use for TKM education. Factors significantly associated with GenAI use or satisfaction included enrollment in the TKM curriculum, older age, prior major, scholarship receipt, and self-directed GenAI learning. Although only 18.8 % had experienced GenAI in formal TKM courses, 96.2 % viewed GenAI as necessary in TKM education.
Conclusion
A notable gap exists between students’ interest and the limited integration of GenAI in TKM curricula. To close this gap, GenAI should be systematically incorporated into educational programs, accompanied by faculty training and institutional support to enhance students’ digital readiness and learning outcomes.

KW  - Protective motivation theory
AB  - While generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is increasingly used to create content, it is often criticized for collecting and training private data and induces potential copy infringement issue. This dilemma leaves a question of whether GAI increases or decreases creators' work sharing. Drawn on protection motivation theory, this study examines how the launch of a GAI system affects creators' contributions on an original work sharing platform. We discover that GAI poses a threat to drawing-category creators, leading to a significant crowding-out effect on their contributions. Specifically, compared with that of non-drawing-category creators, the work sharing of drawing-category creators decreases by 19.64 % and 14.29 % within a short period after the launch and removal of the GAI system, respectively. We discover that creators' protective behavior is driven by GAI-related copyright infringement. Compared with creators without copyright protection, those with copyright protection are more inclined to cease contributions or even leave the platform. We further find that among copyright-protected creators, top creators, evidenced by their acquisition of a large number of supporters or platform honor titles, exhibit more pronounced responses to protect their works due to their higher coping efficacy. Notably, this threat reduces creators' sharing behavior or even lead to their exit from the platform. Nevertheless, such reduction is likely to gradually recover once the threat subsides. Overall, our findings have important implications for whether and how platform managers adopt GAI systems, especially in an original work sharing context.

AB  - Generative artificial intelligence is able to collect, extract, digest, and generate information in an understandable way for humans. As the first surgical applications of generative artificial intelligence are applied, this perspective paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current applications and future perspectives for the application of generative artificial intelligence in surgery, from preoperative planning to training. Generative artificial intelligence can be used before surgery for planning and decision support by extracting patient information and providing patients with information and simulation regarding the procedure. Intraoperatively, generative artificial intelligence can document data that is normally not captured as intraoperative adverse events or provide information to help decision-making. Postoperatively, GAIs can help with patient discharge and follow-up. The ability to provide real-time feedback and store it for later review is an important capability of GAIs. GAI applications are emerging as highly specialized, task-specific tools for tasks such as data extraction, synthesis, presentation, and communication within the realm of surgery. GAIs have the potential to play a pivotal role in facilitating interaction between surgeons and artificial intelligence.

AB  - In telecommunication technology, identifying standard-essential patents (SEPs) plays a crucial role in the management of intellectual property. This technology is regulated by technical standards that are largely based on the content of SEPs. These patents are declared standard-essential by their owners because they contain elements of a technical standard. The declaration process leaves room for over- and under-declaration, which entails risks for organizations. This paper focuses on the question of how generative artificial intelligence can be used to assess the standard-essentiality of 5G technology patents. For this purpose, the standard-essentiality is assessed using different prompts with four Large Language Models (LLMs) in two variants. In the first variant, the LLM results are generated by a rather simple prompt and compared with an approach based on unsupervised and supervised machine learning. The result shows that large LLMs are capable of assessing the standard-essentiality. In the second variant, the best-performing LLM is selected and the prompt is expanded to include selected parts of a technical standard. While the assessment results remain largely the same, the LLM is now able to explain in which detail a patent is part of a standard. This has several implications for patent evaluation, licensing and litigation strategies.

AB  - In the fields of library science and information science, the gap between the obscure language of ancient texts and the cognitive abilities of the average reader is the primary obstacle to the widespread dissemination of the rich wisdom in traditional cultural heritage. The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence technology has provided the conditions for researchers to transition from sequential organization of bibliographic references to the deconstruction and reorganization of knowledge elements. This study, reveals the intrinsic relationship patterns between multi-granularity knowledge in ancient texts from perspectives such as logical relationships, frame semantic associations, hierarchical structures, and feature associations, and constructs a multidimensional knowledge representation model for ancient texts. Furthermore, a YAML prompt template was designed by integrating large language models with the deconstruction of multi-granularity knowledge elements from ancient texts, and experiments were conducted using the Chinese classic “Records of the Grand Historian: Biographies.” The results indicate that the method developed in this study for the deconstruction and reorganization of knowledge elements in ancient texts exhibits notable characteristics such as multi-granularity, cross-document application, refinement, multiple perspectives, efficiency improvement, and scalability, demonstrating potential for application in the field of knowledge services for ancient texts.

AB  - Background
The potential application of cutting-edge generative artificial intelligence chatbots in the capacity of emergency consultants is gaining growing attention. This study aimed to analyse the quality of advice on first aid for seizures generated by a commercially developed chatbot in comparison with its customised version.
Methods
The baseline version of ChatGPT (model GPT-4o) and the same chatbot customised using a specialised knowledge base and prompt engineering were tested in four scenarios mimicking bystander requests for instructions on how to help a victim with seizures. The scenarios included ongoing seizures and postictal states, with or without consciousness and breathing. A checklist-based evaluation was conducted.
Results
In total, 120 user-to-chatbot dialogues were generated (2 chatbots × 15 dialogues × 4 scenarios). The baseline chatbot always failed to consider the victim’s state, including whether the seizures are continuing, or if the victim in the postictal period is conscious and breathing normally. Its advice was non-selective and inaccurate, with frequent omissions of key recommendations on first aid and suggestions of inadequate measures. The customised chatbot-generated guidance was consistently tailored to the victim’s condition, significantly more precise and completely safe. Depending on the scenario, the mean percentage of chatbot responses that fulfilled the checklist items was 14–49 % for the baseline chatbot and 77–92 % for the customised version (p ≤ 0.039).
Conclusions
Whereas the publicly available version of the chatbot is not acceptable for first aid counselling, its expert-informed customisation ensures high accuracy and safety of generated advice. Further research in this field is advisable.

AB  - The integration of artificial intelligence into clinical practice is rapidly transforming health care workflows. At the forefront are large language models (LLMs), embedded within commercial and enterprise platforms to optimize documentation, streamline administration, and personalize patient engagement. The evolution of LLMs in health care has been driven by rapid advancements in natural language processing and deep learning. Emerging commercial products include ambient scribes, automated documentation and scheduling, revenue cycle management, patient engagement and education assistants, and prior authorization platforms. Ambient scribes remain the leading commercial generative artificial intelligence product, with approximately 90 platforms in existence to date. Emerging applications may improve provider efficiency and payer-provider alignment by automating the prior authorization process to reduce the manual labor burden placed on clinicians and staff. Current limitations include (1) lack of regulatory oversight, (2) existing biases, (3) inconsistent interoperability with electronic health records, and (4) lack of physician and stakeholder buy-in due to lack of confidence in LLM outputs. Looking forward requires discussion of ethical, clinical, and operational considerations.

AB  - Aircraft conceptual design is a critical step in the development and research of aircraft, involving complex processes and multiple disciplines. Improving the efficiency of aircraft conceptual design while ensuring quality is an important challenge. Intelligent technologies such as neural networks have played significant roles in areas like aerodynamics and structural analysis. However, due to issues such as high data demands and difficulties in transfer learning, their application in the conceptual design phase has been limited. The rise of generative artificial intelligence, exemplified by Large Language Model (LLM), offers a new approach to this problem. Therefore, this study proposes a methodology for generating aircraft conceptual design solutions based on LLMs and develops a prototype system. First, four of the current best-performing general-purpose LLMs are selected for deployment as foundational models. Then, based on the general prompt framework of LLMs, schema for aircraft conceptual design solutions, and real-world design cases, task prompts for generating aircraft conceptual design solutions are crafted, resulting in three types of prompts: Full-Instruction, 1-Shot, and 5-Shot. Finally, the prototype system is utilized to design conceptual solutions, and the model-generated solutions are compared with those designed by engineers from both objective and subjective perspectives. The experimental results indicate that LLMs demonstrate conceptual design capabilities comparable to those of engineers, exhibiting strong generalization ability and potential for innovative design.

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic conditions that can lead to a physical, social, and economic burden. Generative artificial intelligence (AI), particularly ChatGPT, gained attention for its potential to support medical practice. However, concerns remain about the reliability and consistency of its responses. This study systematically reviews the existing evidence on the role of generative AI in IBD.
Materials and methods
We conducted a systematic literature review following PRISMA guidelines. Studies investigating generative AI in IBD care were identified through PubMed and Embase (Jan 2020–Sep 2024).
Results
From 2875 records, 8 studies (2023–2024) met inclusion criteria: 5 on patient education, 2 on decision support, and 1 on research ideation. For patient education, ChatGPT provided clear and accurate responses, with accuracy reaching 84.2 % in a study, though sometimes lacked consistency. In decision support, ChatGPT’s classifications of ulcerative colitis severity aligned with clinician assessments in 80 % of cases and in 87.8 % of cases for guideline-based dysplasia management. For research ideation, ChatGPT generated highly relevant (mean score: 4.9 ± 0.26) and clear (4.8 ± 0.41) questions, but lacked specificity (2.86/5) and originality (1.07/5).
Conclusions
Generative AI shows promise in IBD care, but concerns about accuracy, consistency, and outdated information highlight the need for expert oversight before clinical integration.

AB  - A deep understanding of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is crucial not only for technological development but also for formulating effective risk response strategies. However, previous studies have mainly focused on how individual factors affect GAI risk perception while the technical functions and features that are the root causes of user concerns regarding GAI remain unclear. To address this gap, the current study, grounded in affordance theory, explored how perceived affordances of GAI influenced user risk perceptions across six dimensions: information, security, technical, social, ethical, and legal. A hierarchical regression analysis was conducted on a survey of 1,031 GAI users to examine the impact of interactivity, agency, and security affordances on these risk dimensions. The results indicate that higher perceptions of affordances such as bandwidth, synchrony, and transparency are significantly associated with lower risk perceptions across all dimensions. Notably, women reported higher perceived risks than men in most categories, whereas age and GAI usage experience did not significantly affect these perceptions. These findings highlight the importance of enhancing user control, transparency, and privacy protections in GAI system design to effectively mitigate perceived risks. This study contributes to the literature by providing a multidimensional analysis of risk perception in the context of GAI, offering practical insights for the development of inclusive, transparent, and user-centered artificial intelligence systems.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications related to agriculture have recently gained in use and attention. They are indeed valuable tools for interpreting data, improving production chains, and optimizing the use of natural resources. Among AI models, the most recent and promising area is represented by Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI). After an initial description of its general model architectures, this work aims to review its practical uses and potentials in the following individual sectors: agriculture, precision farming, and animal farming, as well as interdisciplinary applications. The literature search was carried out using the SCOPUS, Google Scholar, and Web of Science databases. GAI holds immense potential for revolutionizing agriculture, offering solutions ranging from precision farming to pest management and supply chain optimization. Though some applications can extend beyond efficiency gains, and hallucinations occurrence i.e. false output information presented as fact, remains an open issue, GAI can be decisive for tasks like improving training datasets, refining models, and facilitating time series analysis. This review extensively describes the vital importance of these tasks for agriculture, precision and animal farming, caused by the rise of new technologies. As a result, by embracing and responsibly implementing GAI applications, it is possible to create a more sustainable and resilient future for agriculture and precision farming. GAI have the capacity to extract specific information from big data systems, offering huge potential to meet a growing global population demand and consequent environmental challenges for the future.

AB  - In light of mounting environmental issues, the logistics industry plays a critical role in promoting sustainability. While generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has the potential to revolutionize green logistics, several barriers still prevent its widespread adoption. In existing literature, little is known about applications, drivers, enablers, critical barriers, and challenges associated with implementing GAI along with green logistics. To fill this gap, this study aims to systematically identify and assess the existing body of knowledge on the GAI and green logistics nexus, drawing on a systematic literature review carried out in compliance with the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) protocol. The study identifies 34 key GAI-driven green logistics applications, 23 drivers and enablers, and 38 major barriers and challenges. The findings illustrate that GAI-driven green logistics applications, such as risk assessment and mitigation, decision support and real-time environmental response, resilience testing and scenario planning, are essential for developing sustainable logistics ecosystems. Organizational readiness, stakeholder collaboration, and supportive regulatory frameworks emerge as crucial enablers, while lack of digital infrastructure, investment costs, and regulatory gaps constitute significant barriers. The study proposes a decision-making framework to prioritize policy initiatives that could promote GAI adoption in green logistics. This research fills current knowledge gaps and has significant implications for supply chain stakeholders, scholars, and policymakers aiming to support sustainable and cutting-edge logistics systems.

AB  - Background
Clinical decision-making is a core competency in emergency nursing, requiring rapid and accurate assessments. With the growing integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence in healthcare, there is a pressing need to understand its potential as a clinical decision support tool. While Generative Artificial Intelligence models show high accuracy and consistency, their ability to navigate complex, context-sensitive scenarios remains in question.
Objectives
This study aimed to compare the clinical decision-making performance of emergency nurses from Israel and Italy with Generative Artificial Intelligence models (Claude-3.5, ChatGPT-4.0, and Gemini-1.5). It evaluated differences in severity assessment, hospitalization decisions, and test selection, while exploring the influence of demographic and professional characteristics on decision accuracy.
Methods
A prospective observational study was conducted among 82 emergency nurses (49 from Italy, 33 from Israel), each independently evaluating five standardized clinical cases. Their decisions were compared with those generated by Generative Artificial Intelligence models using a structured evaluation rubric. Statistical analyses included ANOVA, chi-square tests, logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to assess predictive accuracy.
Results
Generative Artificial Intelligence models exhibited higher overall decision accuracy and stronger alignment with expert recommendations. However, notable discrepancies emerged in hospitalization decisions and severity assessments. For example, in Case 2, Generative Artificial Intelligence rated severity as level 1, while Italian and Israeli nurses rated it at 1.98 and 2.23, respectively (P < 0.01, F = 199). In Case 1, only 4.1 % of Italian nurses recommended hospitalization compared to 30.3 % of Israeli nurses, whereas all Generative Artificial Intelligence models advised hospitalization. Nurses showed greater variability in test selection and severity judgments, reflecting their use of clinical intuition and contextual reasoning. Demographics such as age, gender, and years of experience did not significantly predict accuracy.
Conclusions
Generative Artificial Intelligence models demonstrated consistency and expert alignment but lacked the contextual sensitivity vital in emergency care. These results highlight the potential of Generative Artificial Intelligence as a clinical decision-support tool while emphasizing the continued importance of human clinical judgment.

AB  - Research on the contributions of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) technologies to second language (L2) education has soared in the past couple of years. However, there is limited evidence pertaining to the impact of AI-mediated instruction on postgraduate students’ psycho-affective factors and the overall learning climate in English as a foreign language (EFL) context. To address this gap, the present study drew on motivational climate theory (MCT) to explore postgraduate EFL students’ perceptions of the role of GAI technologies in their emotional engagement and goal orientation. To do so, an interview was conducted with 30 postgraduate students using maximum variation sampling. The results of the inductive thematic analysis revealed that AI-mediated instruction had affected both the emotional engagement and goal orientation of the students. In particular, it was found that GAI tools fostered emotional engagement by ‘enlightening teacher-student classroom relationships’, ‘making the overall classroom culture/climate engaging, motivating, and updated’, ‘improving teachers’ action, instruction, and feedback quality’, ‘providing a personalized, interactive, and autonomy supporting education’, and ‘taping into learner-specific idiosyncrasies and individual differences’. Furthermore, GAI tools affected the students’ goal orientation by ‘facilitating the mastery of course content’, ‘setting personalized and achievable goals’, ‘fostering students’ performance comparison in the classroom’, and ‘providing a reflective and adaptive learning environment’. The findings are discussed and implications are provided for EFL teachers, students, teacher educators, and policymakers concerning the interplay of GAI, emotions, goal orientation, and motivational climate.

AB  - Abstractive Text summarization is the process of providing a concise as well as cohesive summary, which encapsulates the vital information from the original text. Although the supervised models now in use are competent, they frequently rely on annotated datasets and create challenges regarding uninterpretability and limited generalization ability. To overcome the limitations, this research proposes a Generative Artificial Intelligence Sequence to sequence the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from the Transformers model to generate concise summaries. During the generation of the output sequence, the model takes into account data from various segments of the input sequence by utilizing a modified abstractive cross-attention technique. Specifically, the Generative Artificial Intelligence assists in removing grammatical mistakes in summaries via the application of the Global Surrogate method, which ensures the clarity and fluency of the output summary. In addition, the encoder-decoder model enables the accurate summary generation process, vastly improving fluency and accuracy. Furthermore, the experimental outcomes show that the Generative Artificial Intelligence Sequence to sequence the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from the Transformers model surpasses the conventional text summarization techniques concerning Bilingual Evaluation Understudy of 0.71 and Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit Ordering of 0.73, which shows that the proposed model generates a meaningful summary from the given text.

AB  - Prior learning preparation, encompassing learners' prior knowledge, resources, and readiness for learning new material, plays a critical role in a new learning process. Unequal learning preparation commonly exists among learners with varying socioeconomic and academic backgrounds, and can further exacerbate the educational divide. By reducing learning cost and providing less prepared learners with personalized delivery of information and knowledge, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) may help mitigate disparities in learning preparation. In this study, we investigate the roles of learners' use of GenAI in their learning processes, considering varying levels of learners’ prior learning preparation and proficiency in GenAI use. Specifically, we examine the effects of the use of GenAI tools on learning outcomes through its impacts on perceived informational benefit, learning cost, and knowledge fit in the focal learning process, moderated by learning preparation and GenAI proficiency of learners. Based on an experiment in a programming learning context, we find that although GenAI use significantly reduces learning cost, especially for less prepared learners, the cost reduction effect has not been translated into improved learning outcomes. We find no significant moderating effects of learning preparation on how GenAI use affects informational benefit and knowledge fit, further showing that GenAI tools have not yet been effectively utilized to help less prepared learners or reduce the educational divide. As indicated by the significant moderating roles of GenAI proficiency, to fully leverage the power of GenAI, improving GenAI proficiency can be crucial to ensure learning effectiveness for learners with different levels of learning preparation.

This study aims to investigate the relevance, accuracy, specificity and justification of investment recommendations of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) chatbots for different investment capitals and countries (UK and Bulgaria).
Design/methodology/approach
A two-stage mixed methods approach was used. Prompts were queried into OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Microsoft Bing and Google Bard (now Gemini). Finance and investment practitioners and finance and investment lecturers assessed the chatbots’ recommendations through an online questionnaire using a five-point Likert scale. The Chi-squared test, Wilcoxon-signed ranks test, Mann–Whitney U test and Friedman test were used for data analysis to compare GenAIs’ recommendations for the UK and Bulgaria across different amounts of investment capital and to assess the consistency of the chatbots.
Findings
GenAI chatbots’ responses were found to perform medium-to-high in terms of relevance, accuracy, specificity and justification. For the UK sample, the amount of investment had a marginal effect but prompt timing had an interesting impact. Unlike the British sample, the GenAI application, prompt timing and investment amount did not significantly influence the Bulgarian respondents’ evaluations. While the mean responses of the British sample were slightly higher, these differences were not statistically significant, indicating that ChatGPT, Bing and Bard performed similarly in both the UK and Bulgaria.
Originality/value
The study assesses the relevance, accuracy, specificity and justification of GenAI chatbots’ investment recommendations for two different periods, investment amounts and countries.

AB  - This research employed metaphor analysis to explore 277 postgraduate students' perceptions of the role of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in academic writing. All participants were international students, from a total of 14 countries and regions, studying in the United Kingdom. Data collection was carried out in two phases. The first was a survey comprising demographic and metaphor-related questions, and the second involved metaphor checking, in which participants provided screenshots of their interactions with GenAI. The data, which were analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively, yielded 53 unique metaphors for the concept of GenAI in academic writing. We divided these into four conceptual categories in what we term the 4T Pyramid Model: Technical Support (representative metaphor: high-heeled shoes), Text Development (compass), Transformative Potential (Spider-Man), and Threat (drug). The respondents' academic disciplines influenced their perceptions of GenAI, but overall, the results suggest that most viewed it as transformative, i.e., more than just a writing tool. This study's innovative methodology integrating metaphor analysis with real user interactions offers a framework, aligned with Bloom's Taxonomy, that reveals the multi-level benefits and potential risks of GenAI. It also provides actionable insights for AI literacy education, including strategies for effective prompt design.

AB  - The integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) into human social contexts has raised fundamental questions about machines' capacity to understand and respond to complex emotional and social dynamics. While recent studies have demonstrated GAI's promising capabilities in processing static emotional content, the frontier of dynamic social cognition – where multiple modalities converge to create naturalistic social scenarios – remained largely unexplored. This study advances our understanding by examining the social-cognitive capabilities of Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro model through its performance on the Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition (MASC), a sophisticated instrument designed to evaluate mentalization abilities using dynamic audiovisual stimuli. We compared the model's performance to a human normative sample (N = 1230) across varying temperature settings (a parameter controlling the level of randomness in the AI's output, where lower values lead to more deterministic responses and higher values increase variability; set at 0, 0.5, and 1). Results revealed that Gemini 1.5 Pro consistently performed above chance across all conditions (all corrected ps < 0.001, Cohen's h range = 1.17–1.41) and significantly outperformed the human sample mean (Z = 2.24, p = .025; Glass's Δ = 0.92, 95 % CI [0.11, 1.72]; Hedges' g = 0.92, 95 % CI [0.12, 1.72]). Analysis of error patterns revealed a distribution between hyper-mentalizing (41.0 %; over-attribution of mental states), hypo-mentalizing (46.2 %; under-attribution of mental states), and non-mentalizing (12.8 %; failure to recognize mental states) errors. These findings extend our understanding of artificial social cognition to complex multimodal processing while raising important questions about the nature of machine-based social understanding. The implications span theoretical considerations in artificial Theory of Mind to practical applications in mental health care and social skills training, though careful consideration is warranted regarding the fundamental differences between human and artificial social cognitive processing.

AB  - Recently, generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), large language models (LLMs), Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT), and diffusion models have been increasingly applied to address challenges and inefficiencies within the Architecture, Engineering, Construction (AEC) workflows, particularly in design, planning, and construction management. However, its current research landscape remains fragmented, with limited synthesis of trends and unclear pathways for adoption in the construction industry. To address these gaps, a mixed-method review is conducted, combining bibliometric analysis to quantitatively map research trends with qualitative thematic synthesis for in-depth contextual insights. A total of 148 publications were retrieved from Scopus and Google Scholar (2014–2024). The bibliometric analysis identified 49 high-frequency keywords, grouped into six thematic clusters, characterizing the quantitative research landscape. Complementing this, the qualitative synthesis examined five dominant application domains: (1) proactive safety monitoring and risk prevention, (2) generative AI for sustainable construction, (3) automating design through generative intelligence, (4) construction education, and (5) construction management, within which key research gaps and practical challenges are critically examined. Building upon these insights, the study proposes four-level research roadmap spanning (1) industry-level considerations, (2) organizational and stakeholder perspectives, (3) project-level perspectives, and (4) technological integration. Unlike prior reviews that concentrated on isolated single-model technologies or narrowly defined domains, this study offers a comprehensive, cross-domain analysis of generative AI for construction. By employing a mixed-method review—integrating quantitative bibliometric mapping and qualitative thematic synthesis—it bridges technical, organizational, and implementation perspectives to deliver a holistic understanding of the field. Hence, this review offers clear avenues for future investigation, empowering researchers to expand and refine Generative AI toward achieving a more efficient, resilient, and sustainable construction.

AB  - High gas sensitivity materials are crucial for the development of high-performance gas sensors. Traditionally, obtaining such materials has relied on trial and error, a process that is time-consuming, resource-intensive and laborious. In this study, an intelligent predictive framework using a generative artificial intelligence model is presented, which predicts the gas sensitivity of target materials with remarkable speed and accuracy. To validate the proposed framework, a material database is constructed using ZnO doped with eight different metal atoms, which serves as representative materials. Subsequently, 25 physical parameters, including crystal structure and electronic structure, are calculated using first-principles calculations. Eight intelligent learning models are then trained to predict sensitivity, with the Extremely Randomized Trees model performing the best, achieving a mean square error of 0.02. By combining feature engineering with generative artificial intelligence models, a novel model based on intrinsic atomic features (radius, electronegativity, first ionization energy) is developed, which enables the prediction of CO gas sensitivity in doped ZnO using the generated 12 key parameters, without any parameters from first principle calculation, thus significantly reducing the time and cost associated with discovering gas-sensitive properties. This predictive framework can be easily extended to other materials, facilitating the functional development of materials.

This study aims to identify the most critical factors influencing nursing students' behavioral intention to use generative artificial intelligence by developing a network structure.
Background
Generative artificial intelligence is increasingly integrated into nursing education and clinical nursing practice. Studies have explored the factors influencing behavioral intentions toward the use of Artificial Intelligence, but research specific to Generative Artificial Intelligence is still lacking. It's crucial for nursing students to use generative artificial intelligence effectively, especially as clinical environments change rapidly in the digital era. Thus, it is important to identify the key factors that influence their intention to use.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted. 800 participants were recruited from November to December 2023 through convenient sampling. Network analysis was applied in this study to identify the important nodes that are the most critical target goals for improving the behavioral intention of using Generative artificial intelligence by R package.
Results
The network analysis indicated that Artificial Intelligence Relevance, Ethical Awareness About Artificial Intelligence served as central factors in the network of Generative Artificial Intelligence Intention of using (EI = 1.19, 1.06). Artificial Intelligence Literacy was a key bridge node linking the Generative Artificial Intelligence Intention of using with its influencing factor associations (BEI = 0.33).
Conclusions
Generative Artificial Intelligence Relevance, Ethical Awareness about Generative Artificial Intelligence and Generative Artificial Intelligence Literacy serves as potential targets for enhancing nursing students' behavioral intention. Nursing educators and universities could consider targeted and collaborative effort to improve their behavioral intention.

AB  - We show the causal influence of the launch of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in the form of ChatGPT on the search behavior of young people for apprenticeship vacancies. To estimate the short- and medium-term effects, we use a variety of methods, including a difference-in-discontinuity approach exploiting the exogenous nature of the unanticipated launch of ChatGPT in 2022. There is a strong short- and medium-term decline in the intensity of searches for vacancies, indicating a notable reduction in the supply of young people actively seeking apprenticeships and suggesting great uncertainty among the affected cohort. Occupations with a high proportion of cognitive tasks and with high demands on language skills were particularly affected by the decline. Interestingly, the revealed preferences in the search behavior of young job seekers contrasted with previous expert assessments on the automation risks of occupations and aligned with the most recent assessments of the AI and language model exposure of occupations – before these new assessments existed. Notably, while the supply decline did not reduce the number of signed apprenticeship contracts, we find evidence of declining applicant quality, particularly for commercial employees, the most widely offered apprenticeship in Switzerland.

AB  - While generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been around for many years, it has only recently become available for use by the public. This powerful resource has changed the landscape for higher education and many instructors fear the negative effects it can have on academic integrity and student creativity in the writing process. However, it is certain that AI is here to stay, and it is crucial that educators embrace this technology and teach students to use this resource carefully and wisely. Communication is an essential component in nursing practice and cultivating competent writing skills is a vital aspect of nursing education. However, nursing students struggle with scholarly writing especially at the undergraduate level. Integrating generative artificial intelligence into a writing intensive course offers a unique approach to aid students in improving their writing. In this pilot project, students were given an assignment to actively engage with generative artificial intelligence and critically analyze the response using current nursing literature to support or refute the output. This assignment was used to springboard class discussion on advantages and disadvantages of using artificial intelligence for scholarly writing. This novel approach has the potential to build confidence and competence in novice writers which supports their success in nursing school and in clinical practice.

AB  - Promoting low-carbon energy systems as a centerpiece of global sustainable development goals is essential. As part of this low-carbon transition, smart energy systems have been an active area of research and education, where artificial intelligence (AI) intersects with energy science. It is an emerging area where research and education face new challenges as new knowledge keeps coming in. During this process, generative artificial intelligence (GAI) plays a critical role in education and research activities. However, GAI's impact on smart energy systems research and education is less discussed. Especially, its impact on education is rarely discussed when compared to research. GAI reshapes both the research process and the roles of teachers and students in the course. This perspective offers insights into the ongoing research and education paradigm shifts observed in the smart energy system. This perspective synthesizes existing studies on "GAI for Science" and "GAI for Education" practices in the field of smart energy systems. In research, the impact of GAI is discussed from both macro and micro levels. In education, this perspective examines how a GAI-driven teaching approach addresses the challenges of teaching smart energy systems compared to the traditional approach. This perspective could benefit the discussion of GAI-reshaped research and education in energy science.

AB  - How schoolteachers integrate generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) into their teaching remains underexplored. This case study of 22 teachers from Guangdong delineates four GenAI user types, i.e., cautious adapters, efficiency enhancers, technology enthusiasts, and pedagogical innovators; groups teachers’ GenAI integration into five levels, from low to high; and examines how transformation of GenAI integration is influenced by individual, technological, and environmental factors. These findings extend the Substitution, Augmentation, Modification, and Redefinition (SAMR) model into PSAMR – the “P” stands for “Prohibition” – emphasizing GenAI’s dynamic, controversial nature. They also indicate that, during integration, educators should focus more on human factors than on tools’ functionalities.

AB  - This review explores the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI)—a technology capable of autonomously creating new content, ideas, or solutions by learning from extensive data—on psychology. GenAI is changing research methodologies, diagnostics, and treatments by enhancing diagnostic accuracy, personalizing therapeutic interventions, and providing deeper insights into cognitive processes. However, these advancements come with significant ethical concerns, including privacy, bias, and the risk of depersonalization in therapy. By focusing on the current capabilities of GenAI, this study aims to provide a balanced understanding and guide the ethical integration of AI into psychological practices and research. We argue that while GenAI presents profound opportunities, its integration must be approached cautiously using robust ethical frameworks.

Communication and empathy are equally vital in maternity nursing. However, nursing students often encounter difficulties in clinical communication due to a lack of communication skills training.
Methods
A Natural Language Processing Virtual Reality Communication Simulation (NLP-VRCS) was developed by integrating ChatGPT-based generative artificial intelligence (AI) with virtual reality to assist communication skills training. The empathy, communication confidence, and skills of nursing students trained using the NLP-VRCS (n = 53) were compared to those who received traditional training (n = 52) at baseline (T0), one week (T1), one month (T2), and two months after the training (T3).
Results
After the results were adjusted using generalized estimating equations, the experimental group scores regarding empathy, communication confidence, and communication skills at T1, T2, and T3 were significantly higher than those of the control group.
Conclusion
NLP-VRCS offers personalized training sessions and advice on communication strategies through real-time interactions with a virtual pregnant woman and AI-powered instant assessment and feedback.

AB  - The use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in the manufacturing industry is rapidly increasing. During this transformation, it can be difficult to understand how AI will change the way work is done. This study explores how generative AI could change manufacturing work. Data collection was conducted using interviews and a questionnaire with seven representatives from three industrial companies. They identified several application areas for GenAI in the industrial work context, such as design, planning, training, problem solving, coding and data management. They also expressed positive attitudes but raised concerns about trust, safety, acceptability and interoperability. Changes in work were identified as being more related to cognitive aspects such as changing the way of thinking and altering the interaction with people and machines. Therefore, human-AI design efforts should focus especially on cognitive ergonomics. Findings from this study can be used in the manufacturing industry when adopting AI, as well as in identifying research topics in the human-AI research community.

AB  - In recent years, there have been unparalleled prospects for psychological study due to the swift advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in natural language processing, shown by ChatGPT. This review article looks into the uses and effects of generative artificial intelligence in psychology. We employed a systematic selection process, encompassing papers published between 2015 and 2024 from databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore, using keywords like “Generative AI in psychology” “ChatGPT and behavior modeling” and “AI in mental health”. First, the paper goes over the fundamental ideas of generative AI and lists its uses in data analysis, behavior modeling, and social interaction simulation. A detailed comparison table has been added to contrast conventional research methodologies with GenAI-based approaches in psychology studies. Next, analyzing the theoretical and ethical issues that generative AI raises for psychological research, it highlights how crucial it is to develop a coherent theoretical framework. This study illustrates the benefits of generative AI in handling vast amounts of data and increasing research efficiency by contrasting traditional research methods with AI-driven methodologies. Regarding particular uses, the study explores how generative AI might be used to simulate social interactions, analyze massive amounts of text, and learn about cognitive processes. Section 5 has been expanded to include discussions on political biases, geographic biases, and other biases. In conclusion, the paper looks forward to the future development of generative AI in psychology research and suggests techniques for improving it. We have included methodological solutions such as the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach and human-in-the-loop systems, as well as data privacy solutions like open-source local LLMs. In summary, generative AI has the potential to revolutionize psychological research, but in order to maintain the moral and scientific integrity of the field, ethical and theoretical concerns must be carefully considered before applying the technology.

AB  - The application of generative artificial intelligence technology in the field of visual design is increasingly widespread, particularly showing significant potential in scientific publications. In order to overcome the limitations of traditional journal cover design and enhance the artistic quality and communicative effectiveness of journal covers, this study proposes a method for designing international scientific journal covers driven by artificial intelligence. The method integrates numerous generative artificial intelligence technologies and multi-criteria decision-making methods, applying them to the design practice of food science journals, thereby improving the efficiency of journal cover design and publication. The integrated method first uses the coding method of grounded theory to extract five design dimensions critical to journal cover design and constructs a triple-mapping relationship model of technological translatability, visual expressiveness, and alignment with public cognition and cultural background, providing a research foundation for organizing design elements to align with the journal’s positioning. The DeepSeek large language model is employed to generate creative keywords for the journal cover, which are then translated into descriptive instructions recognizable by Midjourney. Subsequently, Midjourney is used to generate preliminary cover sketches to quickly visualise the creative concept, and the controlnet function of Stable Diffusion is employed to control the outline of the sketch’s line art, followed by experimentation and optimisation across dimensions such as visual style and tonal range. Finally, the VIKOR method is applied to evaluate and rank the six generated cover design proposals. The evaluation criteria encompass scientific content expression, visual aesthetics, and communication and acceptance, across three dimensions with fifteen indicators. The selected design proposals are then subjected to collaborative optimisation between human input and artificial intelligence. The integrated method offers a systematic and innovative framework, enhancing the efficiency, creativity, and visual impact of journal cover design, and provides both theoretical and practical references for future academic publishing.

AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in health research to support a range of academic and clinical activities. While increasingly adopted in biomedical research, their application in traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine (TCIM) remains underexplored. TCIM presents unique challenges, including complex interventions, culturally embedded practices, and variable terminology. This article provides a practical, evidence-informed guide to help TCIM researchers engage responsibly with GenAI chatbots through prompt engineering, the design of clear, structured, and purposeful prompts to improve output relevance and accuracy. The guide outlines strategies to tailor GenAI chatbot interactions to the methodological and epistemological diversity of TCIM. It presents use cases across the research process, including research question development, study design, literature searches, selection of reporting guidelines and appraisal tools, quantitative and qualitative analysis, writing and dissemination, and implementation planning. For each stage, the guide offers examples and best practices while emphasizing that AI-generated content should always serve as a starting point, not a final product, and must be reviewed and verified using credible sources. Potential risks such as hallucinated outputs, embedded bias, and ethical challenges are discussed, particularly in culturally sensitive contexts. Transparency in GenAI chatbot use and researcher accountability are emphasized as essential principles. While GenAI chatbots can expand access to research support and foster innovation in TCIM, they cannot substitute for critical thinking, methodological rigour, or domain-specific expertise. Used responsibly, GenAI chatbots can augment human judgment and contribute meaningfully to the evolution of TCIM scholarship.

AB  - Gas turbines (GTs) play a pivotal role in modern energy systems. Accurate thermodynamic modeling is essential for reliable condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. Existing GT performance modeling methods have relatively poor generalization and adaptability under different operating conditions and different units. This paper proposes a generative artificial intelligence (AI) embedded thermodynamic modeling method of GTs for adaptive performance matching. Possible component performance curves are automatically generated by the variational autoencoder in the shape view. Speed-dependent map sampling coefficients of the curves are introduced to realize fast matching of various operating conditions. The proposed method is verified on 2 different types of in-service GTs in the industrial field with mean absolute percentage error 0.5% and 0.54%, respectively. The maximum reduction of performance prediction error is 2.37% compared to traditional methods. The proposed method can realize high-precision GT performance adaptive prediction with good generalization and applicability, thus providing guidance for high efficiency operation control and health management. This paper shows an interpretable and reliable approach for the integration of AI with thermodynamics. Following the proposed generative-embedded modeling paradigm, performance prediction of other complex energy systems can also benefit.

AB  - Emerging research underscores the growing importance of artificial intelligence (AI) literacy for administrative staff as AI technologies continue to reshape the labor market. However, there remains a limited study about the curriculum components of AI literacy for administrative staff. This study aims to bridge this gap by designing and evaluating a professional development programme for administrative staff grounded in a four-dimensional AI literacy framework. A total of 62 administrative staff from diverse professional backgrounds participated in a 30-h course on understanding Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and its applications. Pre- and post-course conceptual tests and acceptance surveys demonstrated significant improvements in participants' conceptual understanding of GenAI as well as acceptance of using GenAI. Additionally, a thematic analysis of participants’ self-reflective writing revealed increased awareness of the importance of developing metacognitive abilities in using GenAI tools, increased acceptance of using AI tools at workplace, and heightened social awareness regarding AI integration in the workplace. This study contributes to both empirical research and theory-building by providing a structured approach to AI literacy development, tailored for administrative professionals. The findings offer a framework for equipping administrative staff with the essential skills needed for AI-integrated workplaces, reducing barriers to AI literacy across diverse sectors.

AB  - The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies has revolutionized higher education, enhancing personalized learning and teaching practices. This study conducts a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the effects of GenAI on university students' motivation and engagement (cognitive, behavioural, emotional, and agency). By synthesizing experimental studies and applying association rule mining, the study (i) identifies significant positive impacts of GenAI on students' motivation and engagement across diverse educational settings. (ii) key moderating variables, such as subject category, learning strategy, and context of GenAI usage, are shown to influence these effects. (iii) subject category impacts cognitive and emotional engagement, while sample size moderates behavioural engagement. (iv) However, no significant moderating effects were observed on agency engagement. (v) The findings further highlight that individual and small group learning with GenAI, especially using ChatGPT, significantly enhances cognitive and emotional engagement. These findings contribute to the practical application of GenAI in higher education by offering actionable insights into optimizing learning strategies and engagement.

KW  - Management education
AB  - The unprecedented popularity of Generative Artificial Intelligence (henceforth “GenAI”) tools like ChatGPT and Gemini has the potential to disrupt the education sector in general. The initial reactions from educators have drawn a mixed response about the application of GenAI in management education, where some consider it a ‘watershed’ phenomenon, while others consider it an ‘existential threat’ to the teaching-learning system. Subscribing to the positive view, this paper argues that educators must promote the responsible use of AI-based tools, and imposing any artificial restraint on the application of GenAI technology can be deleterious to students' advancement. This is because GenAI will automate future jobs and create new jobs that do not exist today. As organizations are moving towards skill-based hiring, management education must prepare graduates with the requisite technical and human skills required for future jobs. However, previous studies have invested a lot of attention towards the technical aspect of the integration of GenAI tools by recommending capacity development programs to understand the nuances of new technology. However, they have overlooked the important aspect of adopting technology, i.e., attitudes and behavioral rigidities among educators. For this purpose, we argue that to overcome such a rigid mindset, institutions must focus on an unlearning mechanism comprising three phases: destabilizing triggers, discarding existing practices, and experimenting with new ones to help educators adopt GenAI tools in the education system. This study offers multiple theoretical and practical implications. It is a response to a call from researchers to apply existing theories to inform management scholarship about the implementation of GenAI technology and overcome educators' apprehensions that impede the ethical application of GenAI in management education.

AB  - Rapid technical advances have spurred the potential of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in various business settings. However, the tourism industry is in the early stages of understanding and applying GenAI, and comprehensive knowledge is needed. This paper presents a systematic review of the empirical literature, published between 2022 and 2024, related to GenAI in the business and tourism fields. Findings draw a detailed picture of the state of GenAI research. In total, 170 published articles are reviewed based on topics, theories, and methods. Three main topic clusters are identified: 1) antecedents of using GenAI; 2) impacts and applications of GenAI; and 3) technicalities of GenAI. Theoretically, most studies have borrowed foundations from other fields without substantial development. Methodologically, existing research—particularly in tourism—has tended to feature quantitative techniques. This research also compares business and tourism literature based on an antecedents, process and outcomes framework, outlining potential research gaps and opportunities. In addition to synthesizing the current research landscape, this paper presents a multidimensional framework (i.e., theories, contexts, characteristics, and methods – TCCM) that suggests multiple future research questions to inform GenAI studies in tourism.

AB  - Collaboration between humans and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) can result in effective problem-solving methods for smart manufacturing. From this point of view, this study presents how to solve computer-aided design (CAD) problems using GenAI-human collaboration, where a GenAI tool generates structured code (syntax) for CAD while a designer articulates the design intent (semantics). The focus is to see how the information type, model complexity, and prompt structure collectively affect the collaboration. A set of case studies demonstrate that a modular modeling approach with low-level information improves prompt efficiency and modeling accuracy, especially in complex scenarios. This strategy also enables novice and expert users to collaborate with GenAI in solving challenging real-world CAD tasks effectively. The findings support the development of advanced human-AI co-creation systems and encourage future research in areas such as reverse engineering, multi-part assemblies, and collaborative CAD workflows coupled with complex design constraints.

AB  - Companies in various industries are attempting to integrate Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) into their existing businesses. In the e-commerce domain, GAI has shown tremendous potential in generating online reviews. However, existing literature has paid less attention to how consumers respond to GAI-generated reviews versus human-generated reviews. Moreover, little research has explored whether and why consumers are willing to use GAI to generate online reviews. By conducting two experiments, this study investigates how consumers respond differently to GAI-generated reviews versus human-generated reviews and identifies potential factors that influence consumers’ willingness to use GAI to generate reviews. Findings indicate that although there is no significant difference in consumers’ perceptions between human-generated and GAI-generated reviews in terms of review credibility, review richness, and review usefulness, only half of the participants are willing to use GAI to generate reviews. Further analysis results suggest that individuals who consider GAI unethical tend to avoid using GAI. Those with high personal innovativeness are more willing to use GAI to generate online reviews. Our findings deepen the understanding of consumer attitudes toward GAI-generated reviews and provide implications for the deployment of GAI in the online review system.

AB  - The paper explores an innovative approach to evaluate the environmental impact of factory buildings at early design stages. Generative design, a cutting-edge computational technique, is employed to generate multiple factory building design alternatives based on user and case specific boundary conditions, e.g. related to material flow and space restrictions. This paper aims to integrate generative design principles with environmental assessment metrics to improve factory buildings for minimal environmental footprint, e.g. driven through energy demand. Thus, a framework that combines the generative factory design approach with key environmental assessment parameters is introduced. The effectiveness of generative design in enhancing the environmental performance of factory buildings is demonstrated with a case study. A comparative analysis of different designs highlights main influencing factors, as well as trade-offs and synergies between different manufacturing system performances and environmental oriented objectives. With that, the paper underlines the value of generative design as a transformative tool in sustainable factory design and provides actionable insights for architects, engineers, and policymakers aiming to develop greener industrial facilities.

AB  - The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools has given rise to a growing discussion of the potential challenges and benefits that the use of these technologies may present in the field of education. This study examines the acceptance of the use of GenAI tools for teaching and learning among primary and secondary school teachers in Hong Kong. It uses an extension of the technology acceptance model (TAM) with a modified framework that incorporates two key factors: self-efficacy and subjective norm. Data were collected from a sample of 367 primary and secondary school teachers in Hong Kong using questionnaires containing items for six constructs: self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude towards using, subjective norm, and behavioural intention. The results show that fostering teachers' self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, and attitude is essential for successfully increasing their behavioural intention to use GenAI tools. Subjective norm was also found to influence teachers' behavioural intention. To enhance teachers' effective use of GenAI for teaching, teacher development programmes should focus on equipping teachers with comprehensive conceptual knowledge and skills and an understanding of the application of these tools to teaching and learning. Policy support to create a conducive environment for the use of GenAI in teaching and learning would also be beneficial. The study has theoretical implications in its extension of the TAM model as well as implications for enhancing teachers’ AI literacy and developing pedagogies for the meaningful use of GenAI tools for teaching and learning in K–12 settings.

AB  - This study introduces a novel 3D preform design method that leverages generative artificial intelligence to optimise complex forging geometries. The 3D preform shape is simplified by expressing it in a two-dimensional manner based on the geometric features of the forged shape. A beta-variational autoencoder (β-VAE) serves as the generative model, paired with a surrogate model using deep neural networks (DNN) to explore and optimise preform geometries efficiently. The initial training dataset for the generative model is created using isosurfaces derived from Laplace’s equation. A multi-objective optimisation framework is developed to minimise forging load and flash volume and mitigate underfill and lap defects. Preforms were designed using this method and validated through forging experiments on two target geometries: a brake calliper and an electric vehicle (EV) manifold. The forging results of the optimised preforms were compared with traditional isosurface methods, demonstrating that the proposed method reduces forging load and flash volume while preventing underfill and lap defects. This integrated approach combines advanced computational techniques with practical validation, offering a systematic and adaptable solution for the challenges associated with 3D preform design in forging processes.

AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) presents novel approaches to enhance motivation, curriculum structure and development, and learning and retrieval processes for both learners and instructors. Though a focus for this emerging technology is academic misconduct, we sought to leverage GenAI in curriculum structure to facilitate educational outcomes. For instructors, GenAI offers new opportunities in course design and management while reducing time requirements to evaluate outcomes and personalizing learner feedback. These include innovative instructional designs such as flipped classrooms and gamification, enriching teaching methodologies with focused and interactive approaches, and team-based exercise development among others. For learners, GenAI offers unprecedented self-directed learning opportunities, improved cognitive engagement, and effective retrieval practices, leading to enhanced autonomy, motivation, and knowledge retention. Though empowering, this evolving landscape has integration challenges and ethical considerations, including accuracy, technological evolution, loss of learner’s voice, and socioeconomic disparities. Our experience demonstrates that the responsible application of GenAI’s in educational settings will revolutionize learning practices, making education more accessible and tailored, producing positive motivational outcomes for both learners and instructors. Thus, we argue that leveraging GenAI in educational settings will improve outcomes with implications extending from primary through higher and continuing education paradigms.
