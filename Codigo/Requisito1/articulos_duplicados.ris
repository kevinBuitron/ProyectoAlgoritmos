AB  - Although there are different definitions for computational thinking in the literature, it is possible to define it mainly as problem solving, designing and interpreting new systems by thinking like a computer. According to Wing (2006), computational thinking is a way of designing a system and understanding human behaviors by focusing on the basic concepts of the computer sciences. The recent focus on computational thinking as a key 21 st century skill for all students has led to a number of curriculum initiatives to embed it in K-12 classrooms and to introduce computing ideas to students early during their schooling years. The present study aims to explore the effects of a short, intensive coding and robotics training on the computational thinking skill self-efficacy of middle school students. 24 fifth graders participated in the study and data were collected by means of the Computational Thinking Self-efficacy scale (CTS) and one open-ended question. Analyses of the pre, post and delayed tests revealed significant differences between the pre and post-tests.

AB  - Methodological innovations across social sciences are opening new avenues for conducting research designed to address real-world challenges. The benefits of utilizing the Design-Based Implementation Research (DBIR) approach in public libraries to resolve a persistent problem of practice, a lack of assessment tools to evaluate youth Computational Thinking (CT) programs, is demonstrated. Findings from a three-year, three-phased study utilizing the DBIR approach to design and implement a suite of assessment tools to assess CT programming in public libraries are presented. Guided by the four principles of the DBIR approach, this research produced new knowledge, including identifying CT program outcomes, challenges, and recommendations for designing and implementing assessment tools to measure the impact of public libraries' CT programming. Findings underscore the DBIR approach as a strategy for engaging with practitioners and helping shift their perspectives by resolving practice problems and facilitating the design of sustainable solutions.

AB  - Although there is controversy surrounding rewards and competition in education, they are key elements in digital game-based learning (DGBL). Research on the influence of rewards and competition in DGBL often yields mixed results, suggesting a need to investigate individual game elements and their interactions. This study implemented DGBL focusing on computational thinking (CT) in 7th-grade classes. Both quantitative and behavioral data were collected to understand the impact of rewards (power-up or customization) and competition (with or without) on students’ intrinsic motivation, game performance, behaviors, and CT skills. The findings uncovered significant interactions between rewards and competition. Students with both competition and power-up rewards achieved the highest game points but the lowest CT performance, whereas those exposed to the same power-up rewards without competition attained the lowest game points but the best CT performance. Implications are drawn for DGBL research and practice.

AB  - Despite growing interest in early childhood computational thinking (CT), there is a lack of validated assessments for children who are emerging readers. This paper presents validity and reliability evidence of a performance-based assessment of CT using item response theory (IRT) from 272 children aged 4–8. Using a two-parameter logistic model IRT model (2PL IRT), we confirmed that model- and item-level fits are acceptable. Item analyses revealed a high discriminability (M = 2.26, SD = 1.12) and a moderate item difficulty (M = −0.21; SD = 0.86), on average, across 19 items. Reliability analysis demonstrated that the assessment was substantially reliable (marginal reliability: rxx = 0.87). Differential item functioning (DIF) analyses indicated that the assessment estimated children's item parameters fairly, regardless of their gender and age. However, we confirmed gaps in latent ability (θ) of CT by gender and age: boys showed higher latent ability of CT than girls, and old children (above 72 months) showed higher latent ability than young children (below 72 months). Findings suggest the assessment is a fair measure that can serve as a reliable and valid tool to assess CT for children who are emerging readers.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is an important and essential skill for human beings to master in the 21st century. Although CT has received wide attention since this concept was proposed, the current theoretical models have not well defined the complex relations between CT and other cognitive abilities for young children. To provide insight into this gap, the current study proposed a model in which we hypothesized that CT was significantly related to arithmetic fluency that is viewed as an important domain of mathematics. Additionally, arithmetic fluency was predicted to mediate the relations of CT to other cognitive abilities, including reasoning and creativity. This study tested such direct and indirect relations in children aged 5–6 years. Consistent with previous studies on older age groups, the results showed that CT and arithmetic fluency were significantly related to each other and both were significantly related to reasoning ability and creative thinking as well. Moreover, this study, for the first time, indicated that arithmetic fluency totally mediated the relation between CT and reasoning ability, suggesting that these concepts share conceptual commonalities, such as the cognitive processes related to mathematics or/and abstraction; in contrast, arithmetic fluency did not mediate the relation between CT and creative thinking, suggesting that gaining CT skill may exert direct positive effect on the development of creativity. Therefore, despite the root in computer science, CT is associated with many cognitive and learning abilities in other domains, supporting the importance of including CT into early school education.

AB  - There has been growing interest in assessing computational thinking (CT) across diverse learners beyond the traditional forms of tests and assignments. Learning games offer the potential for innovative, stealth assessments of students' implicit learning from gameplay behaviors. This paper reports on the measurement of implicit CT practices demonstrated by upper elementary- and middle-school students as they play the CT learning game Zoombinis. The process of using the gameplay log data to build valid automated detectors of students' implicit CT practices is discussed. Findings from this study provide implications for analyzing gameplay behaviors at scale, leading to the development of models for the assessment of implicit STEM learning.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is critical for Twenty-first century life. Ensuring equitable access to CT depends on preparing teachers to integrate CT into disciplinary curricula. We report on the design, evaluation, and outcomes of the Computational Thinking Unplugged for Science (CT-UP-S) professional development program for inservice science teachers. Our process-based approach to CT significantly improved teachers CT understanding and CT/science integration self-efficacy by systematically linking CT practices to scaffold the generation of unplugged algorithms. Additionally, we found that the process-based approach provided a framework for teachers' lesson planning and that teachers’ content knowledge moderated their ability to write CT-integrated science lessons.

AB  - Early evidence suggests that robot programming offers an important foundation for spatial reasoning and computational thinking; however, researchers have debated how to introduce young children to these skills. We explored how preschoolers develop understanding of spatial concepts and computational thinking as the children took turns navigating a path during guided play with a programmable robot. Our analysis of the data included a multimodal visualization of the exchanges between the teacher, children, and a programmable robotic device. The findings highlight the effects that arose from the physical-digital convergence of technology integrated into play including: (a) the robot evoked a chain of actions, enacting pedagogic forces that transformed children's learning; (b) children used their own bodies as spatial referents, co-locating themselves in space with the robot; (c) the teacher remained a key actor, providing verbal and nonverbal scaffolding to promote children's understanding and mastery of spatial and computational concepts; and (d) talking with the teacher about spatial concepts combined with the interactions with the robot enhanced children's acquisition of spatial ideas relative to the quantity of children's verbal expressions and complexity of their applied spatial skills and computational thinking.

AB  - Workers in the areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics play a significant role in the sustained growth and stability of the global economy, and, thus constitute a critical component in helping all countries worldwide to prosper. In this context, computational thinking constitutes an important skill to have as it enables workers to develop creative solutions to complex problems. Nonetheless, across all economies worldwide, there is a need to have more workers who are able to think through problems, challenges, and solutions in computational terms. It is thus of utmost importance to integrate the teaching of computational thinking in K-12 education in order to reduce the skills gap between education and the workplace. A pertinent and crucial question that arises is whether teachers have the knowledge and skills to teach students how to think computationally. Existing research shows that teacher education departments do not currently have the knowledge to promote computational thinking in their programs. The present study focuses on two aspects of computational thinking, such as, algorithmic thinking and debugging skills with the use of scaffolded programming scripts in an educational technology undergraduate course. The results show statistically significant learning gains in pre-service teachers’ algorithmic thinking and debugging skills in the context of robotic programming activities with LEGO WeDo. Limitations and future research directions are discussed.

AB  - Recent studies identify Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) as a key factor in enhancing cognitive development, particularly within Computational Thinking (CT) literature. However, research gaps remain in understanding how SRL and CT interact from a developmental perspective. Our study designed a program with tailored animations and worksheets to specifically foster students' learning and cognitive development. Using a mixed-methods approach, we administered surveys among 1235 students from 29 Hong Kong primary schools to investigate a dynamic learning system comprising SRL and CT in a large-scale CT program. Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 students to further probe insights. Quantitative findings revealed a mutually reinforcing relationship in the dynamic system, suggesting that higher SRL skills enhance cognitive CT abilities, and vice versa. Complementing these results, qualitative findings showed that integrating animations and worksheets into the CT program significantly boosted students' SRL and cognitive development. These findings have significant implications for educational practices and curriculum design. Schools should consider implementing SRL strategies, such as proactive goal setting and reflective evaluation, within their curricula to promote students’ cognitive development. Furthermore, strategic investments in educational technology, including collaborations with EdTech developers, are essential to create effective, pedagogically sound tools that enhance learning outcomes. These insights provide valuable guidance for creating a supportive SRL environment that fosters cognitive development in primary school education.

AB  - In recent years, there has been increasing interest in integrating Computational Thinking (CT) into elementary schools. However, few studies have focused on teachers’ perceptions. This study aims to examine teachers' perceptions to bridge the gap between theory and practice. The study analysed teachers’ perceptions of integrating CT into school subjects through the constructionist approach, using Scratch a leading programming platform inspired by Resnick's Lifelong Kindergarten Constructionist model. Over a school year, 31 teachers participated in a professional development program and applied this model in their classrooms. The teachers were interviewed to capture their perceptions of learning and teaching using a constructionist method. The findings revealed that teachers with creative arts experience fully embraced the model, while others partially adopted it. Teachers recognized the benefits of constructionist teaching in fostering creativity, motivation, and engagement among students. However, they struggled with balancing these benefits with school demands and constraints. Challenges included managing time effectively within constraints of school and ensuring curriculum alignment. Despite this, many teachers found that the constructionist approach positively impacted students' learning engagement and personal development. By addressing the identified challenges, teacher education designers, curriculum developers, and schools can develop practices for closing the gap between theory and practice.

AB  - Educational research on predicting learners’ computer programming performance has yielded practical implications that guide task designs in computer education. There have been attempts to investigate learners’ computer programming patterns using high-frequency and automated data collection. This approach can be considered as process-based analysis as opposed to outcome-based analysis (i.e., the use of test or exam scores). In this process-based approach to investigate learners’ computer programming process, we included two critical constructs in our research, self-regulated learning and computational thinking skills. We aimed to identify learners’ computer programming patterns in the context that novice students learn a computer programming language, Python, in an online coding environment. We examined the relationships between the learners’ coding patterns, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills. Initially, we adopted a traditional approach with the aggregate data of learners’ computer programming behaviors. We then utilized a computational analytics approach to learner performance, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills, with ever-changing computer programming patterns. In our initial approach, the indicators of aggregate computer programming data were not associated with learners' learning performance and computational thinking skills. In the computational analysis approach, many indicators revealed significant differences between the identified patterns regarding computational thinking skills and self-regulated learning. Recommendations about the use of programming log data analysis methods and future scaffolding for computer programming learners are addressed.

AB  - In the field of education, research has consistently emphasized mathematical creative thinking as a crucial component of 21st-century skills. Thus, this cross-sectional study examines the predictors of such thinking by specifically focusing on the roles of perceived creativity, creative self-efficacy, and computational thinking. The participants consisted of 896 secondary school students (52.9 % female; 47.1 % male) in Indonesia who were asked to complete a series of online questionnaires and tests. For analysis, structural equation modeling was employed, demonstrating satisfactory construct validity and instrument reliability. Based on the results, there was a positive association between computational thinking and mathematical creative thinking. In addition, perceived creativity had a positive impact on mathematical creative thinking, whereas creative self-efficacy showed a negative association. As for the empirical model, it revealed that computational thinking plays a mediating role, connecting perceived creativity and creative self-efficacy to mathematical creative thinking. The findings suggest that incorporating these skills and related variables into the mathematics curriculums in schools is essential for preparing students for success in the 21st century.

AB  - Previous studies have explored the relationship between computational thinking (CT) and creativity. However, a consensus has yet to be reached since both CT and creativity varied in ideation and assessment. To uncover the cognitive mechanism underlying the interplay between CT and creativity, we conduct a scoping review of 26 empirical studies published in 2006–2024. Our findings suggested that the effects of working memory varied in the interplay between CT and creativity due to differences in age range, neural network activation regions, and measurements. Intellectual abilities, including algorithmic fluency, reasoning ability, and coding ability, showed cognitive transfer effect on CT skills but not necessarily on creativity, suggesting that cognitive abilities embracing more intelligent elements may contribute to the functional connectivity in CT neural networks but only partly overlapped with creativity involved networks. Although executive functions (working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control) play a crucial role in both CT and creativity, their contributions to the CT-creativity interplay are still rarely studied. Future research should explore the CT-creativity relationship from the perspective of neuroscience.

Sixty-six papers were selected for this systematic review and analyzed for patterns in relation to the implementation of CS education in K-12 schools and its impact on the development of students’ CT skills. Although educational interventions have not always been successful in CS education, this review provides strong evidence that overall, CS education promotes the development of students’ CT in the K-12 setting while improving their creative and critical thinking skills. We recommend early access to CS education, various innovative instructional approaches to CS education and appropriate support and guidance for student learning.

AB  - Recently, the development of computational thinking (CT) skills has become widespread in the whole world. There is a consensus to develop students’ CT skills through unplugged and plugged-in programming. However, the choice of programming approaches taught in schools is arbitrary and few studies have compared the effectiveness differences between unplugged and plugged-in programming. This study aimed to explore the differences between unplugged and plugged-in programming in developing CT skills of students in Grades 1-2 students. It also explored the joint effects of students’ gender, programming experience, programming interest, and programming confidence with different programming approaches on CT skills. The quasi-experimental research approach was used to conduct 10 weeks of unplugged, plugged-in, and regular programming activities with 124 Grades 1-2 students. The results found that unplugged programming promoted CT skills more in the early primary grades than plugged-in programming. We found that boys and students with programming experience in unplugged group performed significantly better in CT skills than in plugged-in group. Moreover, the improvement of CT skills of students in unplugged group was positively correlated with the level of their programming interest and programming confidence. However, these were not observed in plugged-in group. The results of this study can provide precise guidance for teaching CT skills to early primary school students and provide references for CT education.

AB  - This paper presents an investigation that compares and analyzes the interactions of three groups of pre-and-primary school children with three different storytelling systems. We identify emerging patterns through which they engaged in what we refer to as narrative computational thinking. The latter describes broadened aspects of narrative literacy practices that are linked to computational thinking. By applying a multicase study approach and through various vignettes, we illustrate how children applied computational thinking to understand and influence the narrative possibilities offered by the different tools. Our results illustrate circumstances under which digital storytelling activities provide a favorable basis for narrative computational thinking, and that when computational thinking functions as a scaffold for story creation, it encourages a blend of creativity and computational thinking, providing a compelling approach to introducing emerging digital literacies to young children in a narrative context.

The STEM activity booklet, researchers' fieldnotes, and teaching process video recordings were used as data collection tools in the study. Data that was collected was analyzed through content analysis. It was seen that gifted and talented students participating in integrated STEM activities based on the EDP make active use of critical thinking skills while providing explanations, making associations, questioning information, giving justifications, solving problems, thinking creatively, making generalizations, and attempting to convince others; as for the instances of defining problems, creating solutions, and evaluating the effectiveness of the solution, the students were observed to actively use their problem-solving skills. The detailed account provided by the study on the way robotic and 3D robot modeling activities improve the computational thinking skills of gifted and talented students contributes to the required educational support and to the existing body of literature.

AB  - In the artificial intelligence age, cultivating young children's computational thinking (CT) has sparked tremendous attention. Programmable robotics is a developmental-appropriate and screen-free means that provides young children with great opportunities to learn programming and develop CT. However, it is reported that young children might have difficulties learning abstract CT concepts. As a helpful pedagogical facilitator, metaphors can help turn abstract concepts into more concrete and clear concepts that learners are familiar with. Therefore, this research proposed a metaphor-based robot programming (MRP) approach and explored its impact on young children's CT and behavioral patterns. A total of 118 children aged 5–6 were recruited in this experiment with two conditions: the experimental group adopted the metaphor-based robot programming (MRP) approach while the control group used the conventional robot programming (CRP) approach. Results revealed that children who adopted the MRP approach outperformed children who adopted the CRP approach on CT. In addition, behavioral analysis indicated that the proposed MRP approach could facilitate children's superior learning performance and more positive learning behaviors, so as to help them achieve learning objectives. Accordingly, this study can provide insightful guidance and inspiration for future research on effective programming teaching and CT development for young children.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is a necessary skill for students. It is as important as the other essential skills such as reading, writing, and arithmetic. However, how to improve students’ CT in robotics is still to be explored. Hence, this study examined the effects of computer supported project-based learning (CSPBL) on students’ CT and learning engagement through comparing students’ CT and engagement in two courses instructed by the same instructor (one instructed with a traditional method, the other instructed with CSPBL). Participants were seventy-nine students from a university in China. Questionnaires, interviews, and project analysis were used to measure students’ CT and learning engagement. The comparative results of self-reports and final projects indicated that the CSPBL enhanced students’ CT. The simulation project training based on the SenseStudy learning platform in CSPBL helped students debug the programming code, optimize the algorithm design, and improve their algorithmic thinking, cooperation, and problem solving during the program error correction. The CSPBL also improved students’ engagement in learning, especially for those with more than one year of programming experience. It was found that the CSPBL was effective in terms of improving students’ CT and engagement in robotics learning. This study provides teachers with practical suggestions to conduct effective robotics instruction.

AB  - Malaysia has introduced computational thinking skills as part of a curriculum integration update to meet the global trends in 21st-century education, focusing on empowering digital literacy. Nevertheless, a preliminary investigation revealed an apparent lack of understanding of computational thinking skills in general among teachers. The study explores the feasibility of developing a localized E-learning system to train computational thinking skills among teachers. An E-learning system, termed as myCTGWBL, was developed on the basis of a newly proposed conceptual framework to present computational thinking teaching–learning repertoire to the teachers. The hypothesis is that myCTGWBL would develop teachers' computational thinking and its position in teaching–learning understanding. myCTGWBL relevance was tested through DeLone and McLean's information system and Urbach's collaboration quality construct. To determine the success factors, partial least squares structural equation modeling was used. A total of 369 teachers participated in a two-stage survey. Participants' understanding of computational thinking and perceptions were recorded at the pre- and post-intervention phases. Open-ended questions of the surveys were analyzed using a simple text analysis technique. The closed-ended questions surveys were analyzed using SPSS Statistics 22.0. A significant improvement in teachers' computational thinking teaching–learning repertoire in a relatively short period has been recorded. Teachers also demonstrated increased confidence in the future delivering computational thinking-based lessons. The E-learning conceptual framework has illustrated the predictive power between user intent, user satisfaction, and Computational thinking (CT) knowledge benefits. Results demonstrate that myCTGWBL could be used to guide future planning when establishing CT knowledge acquisition initiatives, particularly among teachers.

AB  - Efforts to incorporate computational thinking (CT) into academic courses have been gaining popularity. CT is a problem-solving skill that is crucial in the 21st century. CT may be used to support language education. Courses in English as a foreign language often need an effective writing component that includes writing organization and language use, as demonstrated by the poor writing samples often generated by students of these courses. To address the problems, CT, which is a higher-order mode of problem-solving and knowledge acquisition optimization, was used. The experimental group was instructed using the CT teaching model based on CT's essential components (decomposition, generalization, abstraction, algorithm, and evaluation), whereas the control group was taught using the conventional method. In total, 58 undergraduate students divided into two groups participated in this study. A combination of writing, CT skills, surveys, and interviews were used to collect data according to an experimental design. The collected quantitative data were analyzed through analysis of covariance and structural equation modeling, and the MAXQDA 2022software was used to analyze the collected qualitative data. The results of this study indicate that incorporating CT into an English writing course enhances the writing and higher-order thinking skills of students. The CT concepts helps students develop critical thinking skills by evaluating the text and identifying potential issues or improvements. Additionally, it allows students to use their skills to create unique writing solutions, which can boost English writing creativity.

AB  - Computational thinking education has become an increasingly popular topic among practitioners and researchers. However, rare is known how to effectively teach and learn computational thinking in early childhood education. To address this knowledge gap, this systematic review examined 26 studies on the teaching and learning of computational thinking in early childhood education from 2010 to 2022. The content knowledge, tools, pedagogical design, assessment methods, and learning outcomes were analyzed. Results indicated that, with age-appropriate instructional design, children could develop early concepts and skills of computational thinking, as well as other related skills such as communication, collaboration, and problem solving. Across the studies, we found that most studies used quantitative research methods, with direct assessment and observation being the most. Several challenges were identified: (1) achieving a deeper learning of computational thinking; (2) a lack of valid and reliable computational thinking assessments for children with a wider age range; (3) selecting appropriate learning tools; and (4) designing age-appropriate activities for young learners. Although with these challenges, computational thinking education could bring new learning opportunities and enhance children's computational thinking skills, as well as other non-cognitive skills such as critical thinking, body-material interaction, and hand-eye coordination. This systematic review informs future endeavors in theorizing a digital learning framework that can integrate computational thinking into early childhood education.

AB  - Teacher competencies encompass the dimensions of knowledge and attitudes, yet few studies have analysed teachers' latent profiles in relation to the interaction between these two dimensions. Latent profile analysis, which examines the interplay between variables to distinguish subgroups of individuals, has recently emerged in studies of computational thinking (CT) as a method for identifying student profiles. However, the latent profiles of CT teachers have not yet been analysed. We therefore analysed the latent profiles of a sample of 493 teachers who had participated in a teacher development programme in CT, according to their knowledge and perceived usefulness of CT. Three profiles were identified: (1) highly knowledgeable with high perceived usefulness, (2) knowledgeable with low perceived usefulness, and (3) less knowledgeable with low perceived usefulness. Qualitative data further triangulated these findings. We also examined the learning achievement of 12,105 students taught by these teachers. Students taught by highly knowledgeable teachers with a high perceived sense of usefulness demonstrated significantly better achievement than their peers. Our findings highlight the importance of nurturing both knowledge of and perceived usefulness in CT. They also provide valuable insights for similar teacher development programmes, emphasizing the importance of peer mentoring support for less knowledgeable teachers. Additionally, we underscore the value of having teachers create artefacts using CT for instructional purposes, allowing them to gain firsthand experience of its usefulness. As few studies have explored teachers' latent profiles based on the dimensions of knowledge and attitudes, the contribution of this study extends beyond the domain of CT.

AB  - We designed a controlled trial protocol that seeks to contribute to cognitive science by studying the effect of thought training on children's executive functions. The study design is a cluster randomized controlled trial, with intra-subject and inter-subject evaluation, with two parallel groups: an experimental group and a TAU control group. With three measures, pre-test, post-test, and follow-up after three months. The participants will be children aged 9 to 11. The allocation will be randomized by groups and not individually. The sample will be a minimum of 44 participants. The primary measures will be neuropsychological tests to assess executive functions. Secondary measures will be a computational thinking test, neuropsychological tests to assess metacognition and attention, and an acceptability scale. The experimental group will participate in the COGNI-MACHINE computational thinking training designed by the first author. The training frequency will be twice a week in 60 min sessions for 12 weeks. The TAU control group will receive computer science classes as usual during the same time as the experimental group. The evaluators taking the measurements will be blinded to the assignment. The investigators in charge of the intervention will be blinded to the results of the evaluations.

AB  - Negative feedback can temporarily relieve negative Chinese transfer (NCT) in English as a foreign language (EFL) syntactic writing by focusing only on the surface writing constructs, neglecting that EFL writing is an embodiment of the process by which higher-order thinking operates. To solve the problem, the researchers conducted a pretest, interventionist group dynamic assessment (IGDA) in the form of negative feedback based on computational thinking (CT), higher-order thinking, and post-test quasi-experimental design, with a control group receiving the direct correction feedback instructing model to mitigate the NCT in EFL syntactic writing. We analyzed the syntactic writing types and frequencies of the NCT obtained through repeated-measure ANOVA and confirmed by qualitative data through video recording. The results indicated that IGDA in the form of negative feedback based on CT principal skills could (1) significantly decrease syntactic writing errors caused by the NCT, (2) improve learners’ EFL writing performance, and finally, (3) elevate the computer as an essential mediation tool. This innovative instructing mode of intervening with writing constructs and higher-order thinking and bringing about deeper thinking and creativity contributes to the EFL writing teaching methodology in a foreign language higher education.

AB  - The tenure system in the United States places significant importance on teaching effectiveness. To date, students' evaluations of teaching (SETs) have been the reigning mechanism for assessing effective teaching. However, prior work has shown that SETs are often biased against underrepresented groups and minorities. The present study analyzes options for effective teaching assessments, which include evaluating final grades and measuring the differences between students’ pre- and post-tests (normalized gain) using standard instruments. The content area and the instrument used in this study originated in the computational thinking field, which has a widespread presence in engineering, where minorities are at a disadvantage. This study obtained a total of 88 student participants from four sections of an introductory engineering course at a Southwestern institution. The study utilized a computational thinking diagnostic (CTD) to inform the course teaching approach (the intervention). Results show that (a) normalized learning gains correlated moderately with SETs, (b) final grades correlated strongly with SETs, (c) final grades correlated strongly with normalized learning gains, (d) the educational intervention based on the CTD significantly affected student learning, and (e) SET comments affect evaluations. The implications include the notion that standardized instrument-driven instruction and evaluations can increase the success of minorities on both sides of the classroom. The purpose of this manuscript is to invite the Heliyon readership to get involved in the development of related instruments and to incorporate these measures of learning into their instruction so biases are avoided or minimized.

AB  - In the digital age, our lives become more dependent on technology, yet the digital gap is intensifying especially because most people lack digital literacy. As a modest step to handle this challenge, we designed a course named "Play with me in Code" to develop pre-service teachers' (PSTs) thinking skills and expose them to learning by creation using computational thinking and programming as part of the constructionism paradigm. The added value of using Scratch in the context of teacher education lies not only in familiarity with a programming language but with an emphasis on experiencing self-directed learning tackling with problem solving situations, creativity, socioemotional competencies, and logical computational thinking. The present study aims to examine 25 PSTs' attitudes towards facing challenges of coding with Scratch. To this end, a mixed-method approach was activated by using questionnaires, blog posts, and reflections. Findings revealed that the learning environment encouraged PSTs' use of abstraction and decomposition to address a complex problem or to design a complex game. Study's conclusions relate to the importance of providing PSTs opportunities to experience learning by programming for raising their awareness of the importance of enhancing thinking skills and creativity in the future.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT), a way to think about solving problems, is recognized as a basic skill for the 21st century. Although game-based learning (GBL) has been shown to improve student's CT skills, students may fail to self-evaluate or debate as they play games, thus failing to develop higher-order thinking. Also not widely explored is how teachers are to practice the CT core competencies during the learning process to cultivate students' problem-solving thinking. As the adoption of student-generated questions (SGQ) is an instructional strategy to promote higher-order thinking, we develop a GBL platform that uses this strategy to enhance students' CT skills, learning motivation, and learning confidence. For this purpose, fifty-three primary school students were recruited for this study, and data were collected during four classes of experimental CT activities. This study shows that the experimental group using the SGQ strategy with a GBL platform exhibited significantly higher CT skills than the control group. In addition, with respect to learning motivation and learning confidence it is found that the experimental group also outperformed the control group. This confirms that integrating the SGQ strategy and CT core competencies fosters higher-order cognitive thinking in students in problem-solving through gamification of the learning environment, resulting in higher motivation and confidence to complete experimental activities.

AB  - To effectively utilize artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies such as ChatGPT and realize their novel ethical issues, individuals must have a variety of knowledge and skills about AI. Such knowledge and skills have led to the emergence of AI literacy. Despite the importance of AI literacy in everyday life, little is known about its determinants. To better understand the determinants of AI literacy, we attempted to build a research model relying on previous research and different theoretical frameworks. The model incorporated digital divide, cognitive absorption, and computational thinking. As a major finding from the current study, computational thinking was found to be a significant determinant of AI literacy, which facilitate using, recognizing, and evaluating AI-based technologies. Moreover, we found out that individuals with physical access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) are more expected to use and recognize AI. Also, motivation and skills in using ICTs enable individuals to better evaluate the outcomes of AI-based technologies. The findings also showed that convenient access to ICTs contributes to a deep involvement with AI-based technologies in the use. Further, individuals with higher motivation and skills to use AI technologies are likely to have a pleasant experience after using these technologies.

AB  - Both computational thinking (CT) and creativity have been recognized as key skills for today's learners. Over the last decade, research of both skills in a single context has emerged. In this paper, we present a scoping review of 62 such empirical from 2011 to 2020. Our goal was to have a thorough understanding of the educational settings in which research on both CT and creativity was conducted, the theoretical foundations it has laid down, and the research tools used. Our findings indicate a geographical bias (dominance of the US and prominence of developed European countries), as well as a focus on secondary education and on STEM-related disciplines; this could be explained by the current situation of CT spread. We also found that when studying CT and creativity jointly, it is most common to define CT in a broader perspective than merely programming of computer science. Additionally, while creativity is largely referred to as product-related, CT is barely referred to as such. Taken together, our findings point out some gaps in the current research of CT and creativity and suggest how it should be expended on the fertile grounds of creativity, as the latter crosses geographical, age, and subject borders. Doing so may build a bridge between CT and creativity in a way that will benefit both.

AB  - This paper sheds light on 3–5-year-old children’s enactments of computational empowerment (CE) in activities with computational thinking (CT). CT is widely elaborated on as a universal problem-solving approach and a skill set necessary for thriving in today’s digitized societies. Scholars claim that CT for all should be ensured from an early age, and several studies develop and examine age-appropriate technological tools, as well as pedagogical approaches, for young children’s learning of CT. Based on 1.5 years of co-designing for children’s situated CT in two Danish kindergartens, the present study conducts a socioculturally informed analysis of video-observed interactions between children and educational robots. The findings display how children and robots engage in interactions that transcend children’s mastery of CT in any narrow sense. This is examined as situated enactments of CE; as children’s critical and informed decisions regarding the roles that technologies, in this case educational robots, can play in their institutionally situated social lives. The paper concludes that children’s various enactments of CE deserve scholarly and professional attention, both as an important prerequisite for, and as a necessary limitation to, the implementation of CT in kindergartens.

AB  - Since the end of the 20th century, the digitalization of society, including the educational systems, has been growing exponentially. At the same time, education systems have been evolving towards competency-based assessment. Likewise, at the beginning of this century, the idea of Computational Thinking was resurrected by J. Wing, for solving problems and designing systems using concepts of computer science. Today, we can see how all these questions are taking shape in a new competence, called Computational Thinking, related to others that already exist. In this paper, we have studied the skills of Computational Thinking in university students, focusing on abstraction and its possible relationship with other factors. Results conclude that the students fail in relation to abstraction and in algorithmic thinking. Although the ability of abstraction is not easy to measure, a linear regression analysis has been carried out in order to determine its possible study.

AB  - Teaching computational thinking (CT) has become a priority for educators and policymakers tasked with educating and training students for future jobs which are predicted to be increasingly automated. Recent research on effective instructional interventions for developing computational thinking skills, including algorithmic and critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity, and cooperativity, suggests that teaching and learning CT can improve student academic performance. In fact, the extant literature is quite sanguine about the topic of CT. However, few studies have attempted to establish a relationship between CT skills and academic performance. In the present cross-sectional study, we employ path analysis to model the structural relationship between self-reported CT skills and academic performance of a sample of 81 computer science undergraduates enrolled at a Southwestern American university. We found few direct relationships between CT skills and academic performance. We only find a significant positive relationship between creativity and academic performance and a significant negative relationship between cooperativity and academic performance. Our findings are surprising considering the abundant research promoting computational thinking as a key component of 21st century skills. The findings call for further in-depth analysis of computational thinking and the influence on students’ learning and learning outcomes. We discuss our results with respect to recent educational mandates for including CT and instructional alignment in school curricula. Our findings contribute to the existing discussion by helping to clarify the relationship between CT skills and academic performance in higher education.

AB  - Although studies have shown that computational thinking (CT) can enhance learning processes and outcomes across traditional subjects, they have not shown how teachers might scaffold children's CT processes in a technology-mediated learning context. This exploratory study examined how teacher talk and technologies impacted the CT of three children (6 to 8 years old). Seven videotaped 90-minute sessions of weekly project-based activities yielded 4,842 turns of talk (2,974 by children). Statistical discourse analysis revealed the following results. After a teacher command, the children more often executed a sequence of actions toward a solution but less often demonstrated problem understanding than otherwise. Following a teacher's open question, the children were more likely to offer logically organized ideas. In response to a teacher's rhetorical question, they more often searched for information. These results inform educators regarding when to use each type of teacher talk to scaffold children's CT processes.

AB  - ChatGPT (generative pre-trained transformer) is one of the artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that have started to be used in programming education. However, the effect of using ChatGPT in programming education on learning processes and outcomes is not yet known. This study investigated the effect of programming education using the ChatGPT on students' computational thinking skills, programming self-efficacy, and motivation toward the lesson. The research was conducted on 45 undergraduate students who took a university-level programming course. The research was carried out according to the experimental design with the pretest-posttest control group. Students were randomly divided into experimental (n = 21) and control (n = 24) groups. While the experimental group students benefited from the ChatGPT during the weekly programming practices, the control group students did not use this tool. Research data were obtained through the computational thinking scale, computer programming self-efficacy scale, and learning motivation in computer programming courses scale. Research findings revealed that the experimental group students' computational thinking skills, programming self-efficacy, and motivation for the lesson were significantly higher than the control group students. In line with this result, it can be said that it may be useful to benefit from AI technologies such as ChatGPT in programming trainings. The research findings, it was emphasized how the most effective use of AI support in the lessons could be made, and various suggestions were made for researchers and educators in this regard.

AB  - In this paper, we explore how the theoretical notion of possibility space offers a way to study how children's computational thinking develops as a process. Drawing on embodied notions of cognition, we first examine the literature that supports how children's computational thinking emerges as a possibility space that involves conceptualizing possible actions in a given moment, deciding which action to take by anticipating the results of a possible action, and learning from the actions that they have taken. We then use a grounded approach to analyze the problem-solving process of two 5th-grade children who engaged in an educational robotics activity over two 50-minute class periods. The findings lend support for approaching children's computational thinking as a cycle of action-taking that includes conceptualizing, anticipating, and taking action. The findings also support the pedagogical practice of having children predict the results of a computer program to enhance their computational thinking. Implications for the way that teachers can support children in learning to conceptualize what is possible and take action from it are discussed.

AB  - Predictive learner modelling is crucial for personalized education. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great success in education, their potential in learner modelling via image data is unexplored. This research introduces a novel and interpretable approach for Image-based Learner Modelling (ImageLM) using CNNs and transfer learning to model learners’ performance and accordingly classify their computational thinking solutions. The approach integrates Grad-CAM, enabling it to provide insights into its decision-making process. Findings show that our custom CNN outperforms other models (namely ResNet, VGG, and Inception), with 83% accuracy in predicting solution correctness. More importantly, the ImageLM approach identifies the regions that contribute the most to the predictions, shedding light on learners' computational thinking knowledge and advancing toward trustworthy AI for education. These results underline the potential of utilizing imagery data from learners’ activities during the learning process to predict their performance, especially in challenging environments like programming where traditional feature extraction and learning might struggle.

AB  - The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has led to the proliferation of computational thinking (CT) education. However, research on unplugged activities’ influence in elementary math classrooms is limited, despite some exploring programming's cognitive benefits. This study presents both qualitative and quantitative analyzes stemming from a ten-week quasi-experimental research endeavor, specifically tailored for third-grade students. The research devised a series of unplugged activities, encompassing mathematical games, hands-on construction of mathematical logic boards, and calculating shopping discounts. The overarching objective was to investigate the impact of these unplugged activities on students’ mathematical creativity and CT. Students participating in a mathematics curriculum based on unplugged activities (N = 47) were compared with students participating in a traditional lecture-based mathematics curriculum (N = 46). The results indicated that unplugged activities exhibited significant advantages in fostering students’ CT and mathematical creativity across three dimensions, namely, problem-posing creativity (t = 5.830, p < 0.01), problem-solving creativity (t = 6.633, p < 0.01), and creative self-efficacy (t = 7.554, p < 0.01). Furthermore, the study revealed a relationship between students’ mathematical creativity as a predictor of CT. The results of the quantitative analysis were supported by the teacher's and students’ interview data, and the students felt excited and interested in the unplugged activities, whereas some students using the lecture-based method reported boredom and lack of interactivity. This research offered valuable insights for mathematics and CT education practice, underscoring unplugged activity as an innovative instructional approach that brings forth new possibilities for traditional mathematics teaching, with potential applications in the K-12 curriculum.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has received worldwide attention due to its alignment with developing 21st century skills such as creativity, problem-solving, and digital competence. With the increasing provision of programming tools such as robotic toys and tablet apps in the sector of early childhood education (ECE), many ECE researchers and practitioners tend to link CT to programming. However, children are reluctant to sustain their interests in programming activities, and may be further demotivated by debugging failures. This multi-group quasi-experimental study aimed to evaluate the effects of a story-inspired approach in bridging the gap between programming and CT for preschool children. Building on previous literature suggesting storytelling as a powerful, culturally responsive pedagogy, 5-year-old children (N=108) were involved in nine weeks of CT learning via one of the three conditions: Story-Inspired Robot Programming (SIRP), Story-Inspired Tablet Programming (SITP), and unplugged CT education. Results revealed that children who participated in the SIRP and SITP conditions showed improved CT scores, relative to unplugged CT education, even after controlling for baseline CT scores. No gender or family socioeconomic effects were found to influence the benefits of story-inspired programming interventions. These findings suggest that storytelling as a culturally responsive approach, whether using robots or tablets as a programming tool, can provide young children with more inclusive and sustainable CT learning experiences.

AB  - Content area K-12 teachers are increasingly asked to integrate computing and computational thinking into their classrooms, yet they often have little experience with computing. The purpose of this study was to understand how science teachers, new to computing and integrating computational thinking into their classrooms, supported students as computational problem solvers. In the project from which this research was drawn, 8th grade science teachers in three US school districts integrated computer game design into their study of climate systems and climate change. We conducted participant observation, collected teacher implementation logs and interviewed 15 teachers engaged in the three-year design research project, Building Systems from Scratch. Analysis through grounded theory yielded several results related to teachers’ orientations, strategies, and use of resources to create systems of distributed expertise. We identified five major themes: a) releasing responsibility to students, b) co-learning with students, c) encouraging students’ independent problem solving, d) building interdependence among students, and e) providing multiple other resources. Findings are discussed in relation to the literature on integrating computational thinking into content area classrooms.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is currently used as an umbrella term in education to describe the processes associated with learning and applying computer science concepts and strategies for problem-solving. Despite a growing body of literature on the subject within education and the development of a grand variety of tools designed to enhance computational thinking abilities, the relations between CT and other cognitive abilities have not been reported in young children. Understanding CT from a cognitive development perspective could be useful for creating targeted interventions tailored for young children. In the present study, we compare a previously reported computational thinking assessment with a battery of nine cognitive tests, which include fluid intelligence, working memory, planning, sequencing, mental rotation, vocabulary, and early math precursors such as numerical transcoding and symbolic magnitude comparison. Mixed-effects linear regressions were implemented with CT as a dependent variable to explore the associations between our variables. A subsample of children who participated in an educational robotics intervention were assessed in their robot programming performance, and its outcomes were compared with their CT assessments. Results suggest temporal sequencing ability and symbolic magnitude comparison are significant predictors of CT in kindergarten. Positive significant associations between robot programming and CT performance are reported.

AB  - The research aims to evaluate the effect of a robotics-based computational thinking program on executive functions and visuospatial skills in preschool children. Additionally, the study will explore the relationship between these three variables and early experiences with toys. The study will be a cluster-randomized controlled trial with pre- and post-intervention measures. Participants will be preschool children aged 5 to 6 years from both public and private institutions. The intervention will involve a new educational robotics device called ROVERSA and will consist of eight sessions distributed over four weeks, with the experimental group placed on a waitlist. To assess executive functions and visuospatial skills, standardized and validated neuropsychological measures will be used, including the Flanker task, the NIH Toolbox Card Sorting Test, the Corsi Block Test, the NEPSY-II Mental Rotation Test, the Pyramid of Mexico from the ENI-2 battery, and the Computational Thinking Test (CTt). Data analysis will begin with a hypothesis tested through ANOVA-MR, and linear regressions will be implemented to assess the relationship between variables. It is expected that the results will contribute to the discussion on teaching computational thinking and educational robotics as early learning experiences and their impact on the cognitive development of children.

AB  - Educators emphasize that computational thinking is especially helpful in raising problem-solving skills, improving logical reasoning, and developing analytical thinking. In this context, the aim of this study is to develop an online, interactive, valid, reliable and useful performance-based assessment tool for measuring computational thinking skills. Data were collected in two stages with three different measurement tools. In the data collection phase, a psychometric scale, a skill test and an interactive web application developed in this study were used. In the study in which a total of 203 high school students participated, it was determined that the students' computational thinking skills were at average level. as a result, a valid and reliable performance-based platform was developed for measuring computational thinking skills. It has also been concluded that the performance-based measurement tool makes a better measurement than the psychometric scale. It is emphasized that computational thinking should be treated as a skill or group of skills, not as a theoretical knowledge, product/portfolio or attitude/perception. Therefore, it is believed that developing performance-based tools for evaluating computational thinking skills and measuring them by using multiple measurement tools will give more accurate results. Considering the developments in computational thinking, it is thought that the study will contribute to the literature.

AB  - Computing education has progressively entered into children's early years. Due to a proliferation of computing education programs and coding tools designed for young children, research on the relationships between computational thinking (CT) and other domains of learning and development is highly warranted. Yet, there is little empirical evidence that shows the relationship between CT and children's overall cognitive functioning. As such, this study explored the relationships between Chinese children's CT and their sequencing ability and self-regulation in early childhood. One hundred and one Chinese young children (Ngirl = 52 and Nboy = 49; Mage = 5.25, SD = 0.73) were recruited and evaluated with three reliable instruments. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that: (1) CT positively predicted sequencing ability (β = 0.27, p < .05) even after controlling for relevant demographic covariates such as age, gender, and family socioeconomic status; (2) CT positively predicted self-regulation (β = 0.47, p < .001) after controlling for demographic covariates. Our findings suggest that CT may be a domain-general ability that is based on cognitive foundations that extend beyond the realm of computing.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is regarded as the conceptual basis required for identifying and solving real-world problems through algorithmic approaches to achieve transferable solutions. Developing students' CT in primary school stages is essential and has received considerable attention. Meanwhile, researchers incorporated digital badges into classrooms to improve students' learning motivation in computer science (CS). However, few solid empirical studies analyze the effects of the digital badges approach in CS education to develop students' CT. Therefore, to bridge this gap, this study designed and implemented a block-based programming course in a primary school and examined the impact of the digital badges approach on pupils' CT skills and self-efficacy and learning motivation in CS. A quasi-experimental design was conducted among 99 third-grade students across three classes. The results revealed that the adapted digital badges in primary school (1) significantly improved the students' CT skills, (2) had no significant positive impact on their CT self-efficacy or learning motivation in CS, and (3) showed no mediating effect of learning motivation on the relationship between CT skills and CT self-efficacy. In addition, we found that whether students could see only their own digital badges or also those of others had no impact on CT skills, self-efficacy, or learning motivation in CS. These findings have implications for the design of digital badge educational interventions intended to promote students' CT and learning motivation.

AB  - Computational thinking refers to a series of cognitive processes involved in solving problems through computational systems. A growing body of studies has managed to demonstrate the correlation between computational thinking and different cognitive domains. In recent decades, multiple studies have taken place that seek to evaluate the effect of computational thinking on higher-order cognitive processes. The current study aims to contribute to this discussion by analyzing the effect of an intervention program in computational thinking on the executive functions of school-age children. In this experimental study, 30 children aged 10 and 11 were randomly assigned to an experimental group and an active control group. The instruments to collect the data were 15 tests of the neuropsychological battery of executive functions and frontal lobes BANFE-2, which were applied to both groups before and after the intervention. The experimental group participated in an 8-week computational thinking intervention during which its participants enrolled in plugged and unplugged activities and carried out block programming language twice a week. The results showed that the intervention had significant effects on executive functions associated with the anterior prefrontal cortex and the dorsolateral cortex, but not those related to the orbitofrontal area.

AB  - Learning coding during early childhood is an effective way for children to practice computational thinking. Aspects of children's motivation can increase the likelihood that children approach computational thinking activities with enthusiasm and deep engagement. Gender inequities may interfere with children's readiness to take advantage of opportunities to build computational thinking skills through activities such as coding. Societal stereotypes can reduce young girls’ motivation to engage with computer science, preventing them from gaining benefits from coding activities designed to support computational thinking. This study examined children's gender stereotypes as well as children's own motivation for computer coding in 363 first- through third-grade children. We assessed gender differences in both stereotypes and motivation, as well as links between the stereotypes that individual children held and their own motivation. Children generally endorsed stereotypes about interest and ability for computer coding that favored their own-gender group, although third-grade girls reported gender-egalitarian beliefs about interest in coding. There were no gender differences in children's motivation for computer coding in terms of their own interest, sense of belonging, or ability self-concepts. Children's stereotypes about their own-gender group were significantly positively correlated with their own motivation for computer coding. These findings suggest that early childhood represents an excellent age for children to begin building computational thinking skills, before girls endorse negative stereotypes about their gender's interest in computer science.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is an essential skill students need if they are to adapt to the rise of digital society, and the evaluation of CT is crucial for enhancing students’ CT. However, the current evaluation of CT is based on a summative paradigm and ignores real CT performance during the assessment process. This study thus used a multimodal cognitive diagnostic model (H-MCDM) of students’ CT based on multimodal data in situational tasks, to achieve precise evaluation and explore the current mastery status of students’ CT and their cognitive and behavioral characteristics. The research results indicate that: 1) students’ CT was at a moderately high level and indicated a good grasp of the CT components of problem decomposition and algorithm design, but students had not yet mastered problem abstraction, 2) a total of six different CT latent patterns were discerned in the overall student results, 3) individual students who shared the same CT latent patterns could differ in their cognitive and behavioral characteristics, while those with different CT latent patterns could share similar characteristics. This study showed that it is possible to capture the degree of students’ mastery of CT and their cognitive and behavioral differences with the same or different CT latent patterns at a granular level, providing a basis for developing individualized strategies to enhance students’ CT.

AB  - In-service elementary school teachers need training to teach computational thinking (CT). A common model for CT professional learning programs includes an initial workshop followed by ongoing support. However, little research has examined the efficacy of ongoing support, the most effective types, and its impact on classroom practices. The current study details a multifaceted CT professional learning program with innovative ongoing support to help elementary school teachers implement the Code.org curriculum. It also empirically investigated the impact of the support on teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT, the effectiveness of each component of the support, and to what extent it affected teachers' classroom practices. Our ongoing support included an additional workshop, grade-level professional learning community (PLC) sessions, instructional videos, and teacher leaders' support. Data included a pre-survey, four post-surveys, lesson observations, a focus group interview, tracking the number of video views, and surveys from PLC participants and teacher leaders. Results indicated that the ongoing support significantly increased teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT. Regarding the effectiveness of the various components of the ongoing support, the additional workshop significantly increased teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT. Teachers valued each component of the support, and this support improved teachers’ classroom practices.

AB  - The present study investigates the debugging process of 526 children in preschool (4–6 aged) when programming a tangible robot. When a child is involved in programming, it is needed to identify and correct errors, or in other words, debug a program. Debugging is a high-level thinking skill and is an essential component closely related to developing Computational Thinking in early childhood education. Though the debugging process is a cognitive function in programming investigated by many researchers in recent decades, most studies are conducted either in primary, secondary education, or higher education concerning beginners or experts in programming. Very few reviews, and some focus on preschool education. Our study set out the following objectives: 1) How do children identify the existence of error and locate it? 2) What types of errors emerge when coding? 3) What type of error is complex for novice programmers? 4) What strategies are developed by novice programmers to debug effectively? and 5) What types of knowledge do novice programmers construct by debugging the tangible robot Bee-Bot? The study follows an iterative model of a design-based research approach. It uses multiple case studies to collect qualitative and quantitative data. The programming intervention was implemented by 30 educators in their classrooms and was based on a scenario-based teaching design. The debugging process was analysed using Klahr & Craven's framework (1988): 1) test and evaluate program, 2) identify bug, 3) represent program, 4) locate bug and 5) correct bug. The main finding is the construction and development of syntactic and semantic knowledge.

AB  - A plethora of programming platforms purports to teach preschool-aged children computational thinking (CT) and coding skills. However, the empirical evidence to support their effectiveness is still in its early stages. A three-week didactic intervention using ScratchJr was conducted to investigate its effectiveness in fostering CT and rudimentary coding skills in a cohort of preschool children (N = 34, aged 4–6 years). While the initial performance mean of the control group (M = 7.07, SD = 2.58) exhibits a statistically significant elevation t (22.64 = 2.23, p = 0.036) vis-à-vis the experimental group (M = 5.35, SD = 1.58), t (22.64) = 2.23, p = 0.0 the terminal performance means of both groups converge closely. However, meticulous data analysis unveils a statistically notable enhancement among preschool participants exposed to the educational intervention involving ScratchJr. Notably, both instructional modalities appear commensurate in nurturing elementary computational tenets, namely modularity and control structures. The experimental cohort outperforms the control group with statistical significance in comprehending potent ideational constructs encompassing representation, algorithms, and hardware/software interplay. Conversely, the control group performs better in grasping the debugging concept than their experimental counterparts. The outcomes lend substantive credence to the efficacy of the distinct programming milieu offered by ScratchJr, underscoring its effectiveness in cultivating CT and coding proficiencies within the preschool demographic.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is crucial for students. Robot-supported learning has emerged as a popular approach for CT cultivation. To understand the effects of robot-supported CT cultivation, the current study conducted a meta-analysis to analyze studies from Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Science Direct databases (2012–2022) which screened using keywords ``computational thinking'' and ``robot''. After further screening, 26 peer-reviewed articles were selected. We synthesized the 33 effect sizes to assess the overall effectiveness of robot-supported learning on CT and its sub-dimensions: concepts, practices, and perspectives. Our findings revealed a medium effect of robot-supported learning on students' CT (g = 0.643), a large effect on CT concepts (g = 0.650), a medium effect on CT practices (g = 0.587), and a huge effect on CT perspectives (g = 1.419). We also explored the moderators (i.e., grade level, study duration, culture, learning strategy, and assessment tool) that might influence the effects of robot-supported CT cultivation. Moderator analyses indicated that short-term (less than four weeks) robot-supported learning had a larger effect (g = 0.901) on CT practice than long-term (more than eleven weeks) learning (g = 0.309). This meta-analysis indicates that educators could apply robot-supported learning to cultivate students' CT and concludes with related implications.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has gained increasing recognition as a 21st-century competency. Although initiatives have been taken to define the term for educational practices, limited empirical evidence is available to clarify its underlying components, especially at the primary education level. This study aimed to identify the associations between CT and specific cognitive skills in the primary school context. Based on the literature, three cognitive domains were studied (i.e., mathematical, visuospatial, and reasoning skills) and standard test batteries were applied to a sample of 633 primary students (aged 7–12 years). Linear regression analyses were performed with CT performance as the dependent variable to investigate its associations with the measured cognitive skills, and demographic features (i.e., age, gender) and coding learning experience (i.e., years of coding experience, extra-curricular coding experience) were included as control variables. The results indicated that the students’ CT performance was significantly predicted by their attainments in numeracy, visual perception, spatial visualisation, and inductive reasoning, and the results remained significant after controlling for demographics and coding experience. The study adds to the literature by enriching the understanding of CT as a psychological construct and has practical implications for educational stakeholders regarding the importance of interdisciplinary teaching and the integration of specific cognitive skills into CT learning activities.

AB  - The sustainable and digital future of work may imply a dramatic equilibrium change between social factors and technological ones. We argue that providing suitable tools to support End-User Development (EUD) in the workplace could represent a way to cope with such future changes. The contributions of this paper include the analysis and characterization of the most used EUD techniques and their crossover with a new conveyed model of Computational Thinking. The synthesis between these aspects is made explicit in the construct of EUDability, which is designed to capture the quality dimensions of EUD systems suitable to work scenarios where better roles and better tools for individuals may be shaped. EUDability has to do with identifying and assessing the difficulties of EUD techniques on one side and the Computational Thinking skills held by individuals on the other side.

AB  - There has been an increasing interest in the integration of technology into language education. Meanwhile, computational thinking (CT) skills are fostered which influence communicative language teaching and learning. Despite CT's established importance in science education, its significance in language teaching remains scarce. This study contributes to knowledge synthesis and methodological development by reviewing 16 journal articles, analyzing CT applications in language learning across educational contexts, intervention tools, CT skills, language acquisition, and assessment methods. The results indicate that (a) more CT-involved activities are needed for primary, secondary, and tertiary education, (b) educational robots and Scratch stand out as the most trending intervention tools, (c) CT skills such as decomposition, abstraction, generalization and so on have a positive effect on students’ foreign language acquisition, especially in grammar and writing, (d) assessment of CT development can be surveyed through a validated and reliable instrument such as computer programming self-efficacy scale or an online platform: Dr. Scratch; Conversely, there is a diversity of evaluation tools in foreign language learning. This study is the first to review experimental research on integrating computational thinking into foreign language learning and offers significant implications for future research.

AB  - The development of programming skills and computational thinking in the formal educational context is one of the most recent horizons set by many educational systems worldwide. Although the first computational thinking initiatives are being applied from the earliest school ages, this research focuses on the secondary education level. Specifically, the objective is the following: to analyse the implementation of Arduino, as well as the benefits and opportunities it brings to secondary school students. For this purpose, documentary research has been undertaken applying a systematic review according to the PRISMA 2020 framework following the PiCoS strategy. Atlas.ti 9 was used to analyse the information. Out of 316 papers identified, 37 were included in the research. In relation to the results, Arduino is primarily used in technology and physics subjects, although it is also used to develop interdisciplinary STEAM projects. As a rule, it is used to learn programming languages, but likewise as a resource to develop science experiments. LED lights, servomotors and breadboards are among the most commonly used resources together with the Arduino board. and Scratch was the most widely used software. The initiatives implemented have yielded both positive and negative results, for example, one drawback is that some projects are very difficult, and some achievements such as: increased motivation towards the contents addressed or also the development of some soft skills, such as problem solving.

AB  - Recently, virtual reality (VR) technology has shown great potential in advancing education with many pedagogical benefits for building the 21st-century teaching and learning experience. This study conducted a formative evaluation of an immersive VR expedition application with the aim of understanding users' learning processes and how the application facilitates higher education students' computational thinking skills. Six participants were randomly selected to conduct this evaluation. A mixed research approach consisting of quantitative and qualitative methods was employed. The study quantitatively analyzed users' scores from gameplay to understand how the intervention supported computational thinking skills. Participants were also interviewed to collect data after playing the mini-games to investigate users' experiences. The study showcases players' computational thinking competency, assessed automatically during gameplay. Further, this study used inductive content analysis to demonstrate users' reactions to prototyped VR mini-games. The qualitative findings suggest that users found the VR mini-games interactive and immersive, which provided an opportunity to foster learners' computational thinking skills. The quantitative analysis revealed that student's computational thinking competency can be enhanced through consistent playing of the mini-games. Moreover, the expedition aspect of the VR game stimulated learners' curiosity, which sustained their learning progress. Furthermore, users gained new knowledge and found the mini-games educative. Nevertheless, several aspects of the VR mini-games need improvements, according to users' perceptions. This study contributes to the knowledge in terms of the affordances of VR in education research and provides relevant insights that can shape future studies, for example, the recent hype of metaverse in education.

AB  - Project-Based Learning (PBL) and Computational Thinking (CT), a teaching strategy and a problem-solving method, respectively, have been widely used in teaching and learning because of their educational advantages for students and teachers. However, studies of their integration into the teaching and learning process have been scarce, resulting in a lack of guidance for educators to implement such an approach that apply constructivism learning theory. This study aims to systematically review and identify appropriate frameworks, models, techniques and tools that could guide the successful implementation of PBL-CT. This study examined relevant articles published from 2017 to 2021 to highlight the gaps in the PBL-CT execution and map their backgrounds into a coherent taxonomy that could help guide the directions of future studies. As revealed, none of such articles explicitly explain any suitable PBL-CT frameworks or models. The study identified several common elements for the PBL-CT framework formulation, indicating scaffolding and inquiry are the most commonly applied techniques, with visual tools dominating the PBL-CT implementation. Most articles involved computing, followed by STEM, with a few originating from non-STEM fields. Several important implications could help educators develop an effective PBL-CT course design and provide some guidelines for future research. An effective PBL-CT integration enhances teaching and learning besides improving students' computational thinking skills. Thinking skills are critical 21st-century skills needed for students' success.

AB  - Computational thinking has become an integral component of curricula worldwide, necessitating teachers to develop this competence in their students. To effectively meet these curricular requirements, teachers themselves need a solid foundation of computational thinking content knowledge, which refers to the understanding and skills they possess in this area. However, despite widespread recognition of this need, few studies have rigorously examined teachers' content knowledge in this domain. Addressing this gap requires the development of high-quality measurement tools. This study details the development of an instrument, created as part of the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) 2023 in Flanders, to measure lower secondary school teachers' computational thinking content knowledge in a valid and reliable way. The article first outlines the construction process of the instrument, which involved close collaboration with experts in the field and drew upon the framework of Fraillon et al. (2023). Following this, the instrument's psychometric properties are presented, which include both item-level and overall instrument characteristics. These properties were evaluated using data from a sample of 352 participants, applying both Classical Test Theory and Item Response Theory. The final tool consists of sixteen multiple-choice and short constructed response questions. The results indicate favorable item and overall instrument characteristics, thereby affirming its potential to measure the intended construct in a valid and accurate way.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) skills help students both understand and utilize computing in various domains to cope with the challenges posed by the complex digital world. This study applied mind mapping to programming language instruction in a primary school, and explored the effects of mind mapping on students' CT skills when learning programming with Scratch as a programming tool. Two types of mind mapping, construct-by-self mind mapping (CBS-MM) and construct-on-scaffold mind mapping (COS-MM), were proposed to compare which type is more effective in terms of students' CT skills. Seventy-three public primary school fifth-grade students aged 10 to 11 participated in the study. The CBS group included 33 students learning with the CBS-MM instructional approach, while the COS group comprised 40 students learning with the COS-MM instructional approach. Data were obtained from nine topic Scratch programming assignments and pre- and post-CT skills surveys completed by the two groups. Paired sample t tests were used to analyze whether the two types of mind mapping approach could improve both groups' CT skills. One-way ANCOVA and one-way ANOVA were used to examine the difference in the two groups' CT skills. The results showed that both CBS-MM and COS-MM can improve students' CT skills; however, the COS group students could better improve their CT skills with the assistance of the COS-MM method compared with the CBS group students who learned with the CBS-MM method. The findings of this study can provide some enlightenment for relevant instructors to design instruction and implement programming teaching with different kinds of mind mapping support that facilitates students’ CT.

AB  - The specific mechanisms by which teachers and parents can provide culturally relevant opportunities for computational thinking for racially/ethnically and linguistically diverse groups of preschoolers remain unknown. Accordingly, the purpose of this research is to examine how PreK parent and teacher voice directed efforts to realize a culturally relevant computing program. We drew data sources from a subsample of design-based research meetings in which partners collaborated to co-develop the first iteration of the program. Using qualitative analysis, we examined how parent voice and teacher voice, conceptualized as perspectives and participation, influenced theories of culturally responsive computing and computational thinking in early childhood education and the translation of theory into practice in classroom and home settings. Findings showed that connecting powerful ideas from computational thinking, namely algorithms and problem solving (e.g., debugging), to familiar activities and experiences served as a powerful entry point. Yet, differences arose in how teachers and parents conceptualized culturally relevant computing and made connections to familiar routines. We discuss what can be learned from parent voice in regards to bolstering children's self-expression, access to increasingly complex computational thinking tasks, and opportunities for learning cultural and community values through computing.

AB  - In recent years, the development of computational thinking (CT) has become integral to many school curricula worldwide. This has been associated with calls for computational thinking to be considered a ‘21St Century’ competency, valuable to all students as a transferable process for solving problems and building understanding of human behaviour and systems. However, while computational thinking is a focus of most secondary school computer science curricula, proponents such as Jeanette Wing argue its relevance for younger students, indicating more work must be done investigating its development in early years' education. This study used a structured, problem-based curriculum supported by guided inquiry pedagogy, to explore 6 year old students' learning of basic computational thinking concepts and practices while coding programmable floor robots (Blue-bots and an iPad app). Results indicated improvement across the seven lessons in students' sequencing/algorithm authoring, error correction, and pattern recognition. Furthermore, they revealed evidence of higher order thinking such as identifying patterns in code, and how these can be transferred to help solve problems of different designs. While currently play-based approaches are used to introduce computational thinking concepts and practices in early years' education, results from this study suggest that more structured, problem-based methods should be seriously considered. Results challenge commonly understood developmental theories about what young children can and can't do, contextualised within the field of computer science, and hold implications for early years' teachers' professional knowledge and pedagogy if they are to promote their students' learning in this increasingly important area. Given rapid technological advancements such as artificial intelligence (AI) and increasingly earlier exposure of young children to digitally-mediated information, this study provides support for the earlier and more systematic introduction of basic digital literacy knowledge and skills in early years' education.

AB  - We conducted a systematic review of empirical studies aimed at exploring robot-mediated activities to promote the development of computational thinking in preschoolers. In this study, we investigated the robots used, proposed activities, and evaluation processes. We also analyzed research contexts and the stated motivations to conduct the studies. Our review identified characteristics of the robots, such as input and output interfaces, cost, and availability. We also categorized activities considering context, modality of work, type of activities, duration, adults’ role, scaffolding, unplugged activities, explicit debugging, communication and sharing instances, and teaching knowledge from other domains. We analyzed the computational thinking evaluation process looking at types of assessments, asset concepts, and research design. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of existing research, identifies existing gaps, and provides recommendations for future studies.

AB  - The integration of computational thinking (CT) into K-12 education offers substantial potential to improve digital literacy and deepen students’ understanding across various subject areas. By embedding computational procedures and solution-oriented approaches into traditional curricula, students can develop essential skills that are critical for thriving in an increasingly digital world. However, the effective integration of CT into subject-specific learning poses challenges for educators, largely due to a lack of training and experience in implementing interdisciplinary instructional strategies. This study explores the impact of integrating CT into K-12 education through diverse instructional approaches, including modelling, storytelling, and unplugged activities. The research examines how students' subject knowledge, CT concepts, and practices evolved under each CT integration practice, as well as their acceptance toward CT integrated lessons. The study was conducted in different subjects, including language arts, biology, and physics, and at different grade levels. The technology acceptance model was used as a theoretical framework to understand students' adoption towards the different integration practices. The study revealed that different CT integration practices yield varying impacts on students' attitudes, particularly in relation to their prior programming experiences. Namely, primary school students with prior programming experience display a higher behavioural intention due to a lack of early biases toward programming. Conversely, secondary school students, less familiar with interdisciplinary approaches, initially show less enthusiasm for future engagement. These insights underscore the need for tailored instructional strategies that consider students' prior experiences and the broader goal of preparing them to contribute to a technologically driven society.

AB  - As we begin to identify essential skills for the future, there has been an increased focus on how to define and implement computational thinking within education. However, the question of how to engage children with coding activities within the context and limitations of the curriculum remains relatively explored. In our study, a human-centered design approach was followed to guide a small group of children through the co-design, implementation and evaluation of a board game. The board game had two versions: an offline version involving a robotic agent and an online version with its digital equivalent. A mixed-method approach was used to understand and compare levels of engagement, usability, and collaboration in both versions of the game. The tangible aspect of working with a robotic agent in the offline version led to greater levels of motivation and involvement with the game mechanics. Tangible robotics games tend to be more approachable for children. Our study shows that using such games by connecting the mathematics curriculum with coding problems can successfully engage participants in collaborative computational thinking activities. We contribute to the field by providing human-centered guidance for the creation of educational tools to develop computational thinking. Such guidance is not only applicable in technologically rich environments; it can also be applied in educational communities with limited access to technology.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has been relevant in teaching STEM courses, and educators are incorporating both plugged and unplugged CT activities in their modules to prepare new entrants for advanced knowledge. However, additional empirical data are needed to understand how an unplugged activities approach can lead to an improved understanding of CT concepts. Therefore, this study investigates the impact of unplugged activities on novice students' CT skills and unravels the characteristics of students' CT competency from performing unplugged activities. The experimental aspect of this study was conducted with a cohort of 210 students participating in an introductory programming course at a University in Nigeria. A mixed-method research approach and a quasi-experimental design were applied in this study to understand how the unplugged approach in teaching CT could help students improve their CT competency. A paired-sample t-test of familiarity score for each CT concept showed a significant increase in the score before and after the intervention. Furthermore, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was used for topic modeling of the text describing students’ solutions. Topic modeling allows for more insights into the steps taken by the students to solve CT problems. Only 27.62 % of students' solution descriptions contained CT concepts, 56.90 % of the students solved the puzzle with an optimal score, and 72.41 % of students who applied CT concepts of problem abstraction and decomposition were able to solve the puzzle correctly. Indeed, CT unplugged activities significantly increased the number of students who gained CT competency. In addition, this study provides recommendation for computer science educators and highlight future direction.

AB  - Computational thinking is a fundamental competence that is being introduced in K-12 and succeeding curricula worldwide. Despite this huge effort, many computational thinking models in the literature do not explicitly take into consideration the pupils’ age and the developmental nature of computational thinking skills. Furthermore, many existing computational thinking models are focused on the internal thinking processes of the individuals, failing to explicitly consider the situated nature, in terms of social context and artefactual environment, that usually characterise tasks that require computational thinking to be solved. In this paper, we present a framework for the design, realisation, analysis, and assessment of computational thinking activities, called CT-cube. The CT-cube allows to extend existing computational thinking models to consider the life-long development of computational thinking skills in individuals, from childhood to adult age, and to take into consideration the situated nature of computational thinking activities. We use the CT-cube to design an unplugged task, called Cross Array Task (CAT), allowing to assess the algorithmic skills of K-12 pupils and we show how the CT-cube can be used in this case to illustrate the development of this competence along the entire compulsory school path, considering a sample of 109 pupil aged 3 to 16 in Switzerland.

AB  - The current single teaching and assessing modes of English as a foreign language (EFL) grammar in China have caused the disconnect between grammar knowledge and competency with numerous errors in essay writing, somehow ignoring the analysis of learners thinking patterns. To solve the problem, computational thinking (CT), a higher-order thinking in solving problems and optimizing the way to acquire knowledge, was employed in the study. As needed, the experimental group was taught using the CT teaching model following CT principal elements (data analysis, pattern recognition, abstraction, decomposition, and parallelization), while the control group followed the traditional teaching mode. Quantitative and qualitative data were obtained based on the pre-test-post-test, classroom observation, and questionnaire survey. The results show that the grammar application in short essay writing of all the members of the experimental group significantly improved and that higher grammar learning agency and engagement were unfolded to show the changes of thinking patterns. However, not all the members from the control group showed similar results. CT serves as an important social mediation tool in EFL teaching. This study further enriches the teaching modes of grammar and is an effective attempt at introducing CT into learners’ thinking patterns.

AB  - With growing interest in supporting the development of computational thinking (CT) in early childhood, there is also need for new assessments that serve multiple purposes and uses. In particular, there is a need to understand the design of formative assessments that can be used during classroom instruction to provide feedback to teachers and children in real-time. In this paper, we report on an empirical study and advance a new unit of observational analysis for formative assessment that we call an indicator of a knowledge refinement opportunity or as a shorthand, KRO indicators. We put forth a new framework for conceptualizing the design of formative assessments that builds on the Evidence Centered Design framework but centers identification and analysis of indicators of knowledge refinement opportunities. We illustrate a number of key indicators through empirical examples drawn from video recordings of Kindergarten classroom lessons.

AB  - Interest in coding education has exploded in the past five years, especially in elementary and early secondary education. Teachers who are largely new to coding are expected to guide entire student bodies through the fundamentals of coding and computational thinking. But little is known about which coding and computational thinking (CT) concepts teachers feel most comfortable with and which concepts they struggle with. This study describes 127 elementary coding teachers’ changes in their beliefs about teaching coding and CT as they participated in year-long continuous professional development. Novice elementary coding teachers demonstrated most growth in their self-efficacy for teaching sequences, algorithms and loops. They were less secure in their knowledge of conditionals, variables, and functions. For computational thinking, teachers were most confident in their ability to identify patterns, think algorithmically, understand logic, and evaluate outcomes, showing less growth with decomposition and abstraction.

AB  - This study compares the effects of coding education with educational robot and unplugged coding activities on pre-school students' computational thinking and executive function skills. This study used a pre-test and post-test comparison group quasi-experimental design. The study was conducted in a public kindergarten with 48 pre-school students (24 educational robot- BeeBot® group and 24-unplugged coding group) aged 5-6. The TechCheck-K test was used to measure computational thinking skills, and Executive Functions Battery-Computerized Touch was used to measure executive function skills. The process started with pre-test applications and ended with post-tests after four weeks (16 different sessions) of the implementation in both groups. The study found a statistically significant difference between the computational thinking pre-test and post-test scores of pre-school students in both groups in favor of the post-test. It was determined that there was a statistically significant difference in favor of the educational robot group between the post-test scores of computational thinking skills. In addition, when the findings regarding executive functions were evaluated, there was a statistically significant difference between the pre-test and post-test scores of total executive function in favor of the post-test in both groups. However, it was observed that there was no statistically significant difference between the post-test scores of both groups in terms of total executive function skills scores. In addition, when the post-test scores of pre-school students in two groups were evaluated, it was determined that there was no significant difference in computational thinking and executive function skills according to gender. Consequently, it was determined that coding education with an educational robot was more effective for gaining computational thinking skills than unplugged coding activities for pre-school students. However, it was observed that there was no difference between the two groups in terms of the development of executive function skills in pre-school education.

AB  - Since environmental and energy issues and challenges continues to emerge as key global concerns, Green Building Certification Systems are becoming increasingly relevant in the construction industry. In this regard, LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is considered one of the most widely recognized environmental assessment methods used globally in the construction industry today. However, due to the high level of complexity of the LEED system, the tools usually used to verify the achievement of the credits lack of “design friendliness” and hardly communicate effectively with the conventional tools used by architects and engineers (e.g. CAD, BIM). This makes difficult to fully take into account, especially at the early design stage, the many interconnected aspects that contribute to the green certification, with consequent issues often arising in the design validation and/or construction phases, resulting in time delays and cost increments. The application of innovative problem-solving methods, such as computational thinking, together with coding techniques, represents an effective way to deal with this issue. This kind of methodology, in fact, allows the requirements of a specific LEED credit to be digitally parametrised and flexibly incorporated into a “designer friendly” working environment. In particular, Visual Programming Languages (VPLs), due to their high simplicity of usage, allow architects and engineers to develop algorithms and thus implement their technical knowledge in the field of environmental design with computer programming skills, useful to improve their tools and keep them constantly updated. The aim of this paper is to illustrate a methodology through which, by merging computational thinking strategies with VPL tools, is possible to keep under control, in the same working environment, all the parameters required to verify in real time the achievement of LEED credits. To demonstrate the flexibility of the approach, dedicated tools developed for the verification of some specific credits at different scales – neighbourhood and building – are illustrated as operational examples of the proposed methodology.

AB  - Computational thinking, defined by Wing (2011) as the “thought processes involved in formulating problems … so that the solutions are represented in a form that can effectively be carried out by an information-processing agent,” has become the central construct of K12 computing education around the world. This article provides a history of computational thinking, a summary of computational thinking's role in educational policy and practice, role as a research construct, and concludes by considering the future of computational thinking. The debate over how to define and teach computational thinking can be understood as a proxy for the broader questions about education.

AB  - Collecting and organizing data to understand and answer real-world questions is an increasingly important skill in our current world. Fostering data collection and analysis (DCA) skills in young children leverages key mathematics skills as well as the data representation, visualization, and interpretation skills of computational thinking (CT), culminating in a problem-solving approach with data. As such, the intervention, comprising investigations and a digital app, supported preschool teachers and children to answer data-focused questions by engaging in each step of the DCA process in order to foster CT and math skills. Teachers appreciated that the app offers a new way for children to visualize data and noted that the app provided learning opportunities for children that would not otherwise be possible or easy to implement. Results also suggest that the app provides a systematic process for data collection, entry, and interpretation. Children in classrooms that completed the intervention had significantly higher scores at post-intervention compared to children in classrooms that did not complete the intervention, controlling for pre-intervention scores, B(SE) = 0.13(0.05), t (6) = 2.48, p = .048.

AB  - Computational Thinking (CT), the conceptual foundations required for solving complex problems effectively and efficiently, is an imperative skill for today's learners, across disciplines and across ages. As for its importance in the wide network of digital literacies, CT has been implemented in various educational contexts, however mostly via digital artifacts, specifically in programming-related activities. This approach does not fulfill the potential of such integration for promoting learning. In this paper, we argue that digital literacies should not be bound to the digital realm, and present a novel approach to fully integrate CT into learning and teaching by the development of CT-infused “unplugged” pedagogical tools that are fully embedded in the subject matter. We demonstrate the advantages to student learning of these tools in two case studies from K-12 mathematics education: 1) An assistive tool for function investigation in high-school calculus – in this case, we point out to how CT skills that were implemented in the tool promoted students' problem solving; 2) A teaching unit for pattern sequences in elementary school – in this case, we show how students in the CT research group outperformed students in the other groups, and how they implemented CT to solve pattern sequence problems effectively and efficiently. We highlight that besides enhancing learning, this approach can help address the important issue of equity in education, and suggest ways to promote it via dedicated professional development.

AB  - Creativity and Computational Thinking (CT) have been pointed out as two important skills that would promote students in the digital age as contributing members of society. Therefore, these two constructs have been extensively researched in recent years, but the associations between them are yet to be fully understood. This study takes another step towards bridging this gap by examining the association between CT and three types of creativity, i.e., Figural Creative Thinking, Verbal Creative Thinking, and Computational Creativity. Data was collected from 119 ninth-grade students (14–15 years old) from Israel. Students took two commonly used creativity tests (Torrance's Test of Creative Thinking, and the Alternative Uses Test). They also used Kodetu—an online learning environment for CT—and we used the system log files to measure their CT acquirement and their computational creativity. Findings suggest some nuanced associations between the four sets of variables. Specifically, we point out the limited associations between verbal and figural creativities, some of which are negative; also, we found that the associations between creative thinking and CT, as well as between creative thinking and computational creativity, differ by gender.

AB  - Many studies have demonstrated that Virtual Exchange (VE) for teaching languages can have a positive effect on learners' intercultural awareness or achievements. However, during this century, the teaching process has shifted from teaching with technology to solving problems with it. In this regard, pedagogical experts in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) have developed programming and robotics based on Computational Thinking skills (CTs), which have been regarded as the core of 21st-century skills. In the field of CALL, this skill has received very little attention. Accordingly, we have attempted to switch the process and outcome of language learning in VE. Thus, we developed the conceptual framework that integrated CTsCALL and Individual-technology-task-environment Fit (ITTEF). Having designed our VE tasks based on CTsCALL, we provided the opportunity for 92 Spanish language learners in our project to exchange language and culture with Cypriot and Irish students and solve VE tasks based on CTsCALL. The result of the symmetric phase of the study validated the five-dimensional structure of CTsCALL and the four-dimensional structures of ITTEF in VE and CALL. It also revealed that language learners, who focused on the key information rather than the details while solving language tasks, as well as recognizing the pattern of task solving and applying them to other tasks, found VE, and CTsCALL to be aligned with their current capabilities, learning environment, and problem-solving skills that mediated their intention to learn and exchange information in this context in the future. Furthermore, the asymmetrical part of the study revealed that sixteen solutions are available to shape language learners' continued intention to use VE by combining the components of CTsCALL and ITTEF. Thus, the study developed the CTsCALL questionnaire and its theory into CALL together with the Council of Europe's Common European Framework of Reference for Languages and recommended that CALL researchers and educators take a broader view of VE, as well as continuing to validate CTsCALL in other CALL disciplines to show that this skill belongs to CALL as well.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is gaining increasing attention from researchers and practitioners all over the world to empower children in the digital era. However, there is no consensus on which components of CT to teach beginning coders in early childhood education (ECE). To address this issue, we conducted a systematic review of 42 empirical studies focused on teaching and assessing CT in ECE. We analyzed the included studies with the three-dimensional CT framework proposed by Brennan and Resnick (2012) and demonstrated how this framework could be modified to fit the context of ECE. Based on this systematic review, we sorted out the CT components that were proven suitable for young children to learn by incorporating emerging components and removing components inappropriate for young children. We thus proposed a CT curriculum framework for ECE that covers CT concepts (i.e., control flow/structures, representation, and hardware/software), CT practices (i.e., algorithmic design, pattern recognition, abstraction, debugging, decomposition, iteration, and generalizing), and CT perspectives (i.e., expressing and creating, connecting, perseverance, and choices of conduct). This systematic review and its associated CT curriculum framework provide important theoretical contributions and practical implications for early childhood CT education.

AB  - In this paper, we review and meta-analyze the findings of experimental studies published between 2006 and 2022 that examined the effects of coding and programming interventions on children's core and higher order executive functions (response inhibition, working memory, cognitive flexibility, planning and problem solving). The systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to address three research questions: 1) Which executive functions are most impacted by the teaching of CT? 2) Which instructional modality (educational robotics/virtual coding/unplugged coding) is most effective in enhancing executive function skills in learners aged 4–16 years? and 3) Does the cognitive effectiveness of coding vary with children's age? A total of 19 studies with 1523 participants met the selection criteria for the systematic review. The meta-analysis included 11 of those studies. The results reveal beneficial effects of structured virtual and tangible coding (educational robotics) activities for preschoolers and first graders, and significant effects of more unstructured virtual coding activities (e.g., Scratch-based) for older students. A multivariate fixed-effects model meta-analysis shows that the teaching of coding significantly improves problem-solving with the highest effect (dppc2 = 0.89), but also planning (dppc2 = 0.36), and inhibition and working memory with lower effects (dppc2 = 0.17, dppc2 = 0.20).

AB  - In light of the increasing importance digital economy, the significance of computational thinking has grown exponentially, becoming imperative in both workplace and academic settings such as universities. This article addresses the critical need to comprehend the factors influencing the acceptance of computational thinking. The dataset introduces an extensive questionnaire comprising five constructs and 25 items, rooted in the extended Technology Acceptance Model. Notably, the model incorporates facilitating conditions and subjective norm, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding acceptance. Data collection involved 132 undergraduate university students sampled through purposive sampling, specifically targeting courses with a focus on computational thinking. The resulting dataset serves as a valuable resource for future research, offering detailed insights into the factors determining the acceptance of technology in educational contexts beyond mere thinking skills. Given the scarcity of research on technology acceptance in developing nations, this dataset holds particular significance, serving as a foundation for potential cross-cultural comparisons. The dataset contributes to the field by presenting a robust acceptance model, explaining 74.2 per cent of the variance in behavioural intention, 60.2 per cent in perceived usefulness, and 56.1 per cent in perceived ease of use. This high explanatory power positions the dataset as a superior resource for replication, benchmarking, and broader applicability in diverse contexts, thereby enhancing the understanding of computational thinking acceptance across different populations and settings. This dataset stands among the pioneering efforts to assess the novel covariance-based structural equation model algorithm within SmartPLS 4, presenting a valuable resource for future research employing the same mechanism.

AB  - This paper describes a study designed to investigate the promise of resources that support the development of computational thinking (CT) in preschool children. This study was the culmination of a collaborative research process between researchers and media developers of a home-based intervention that included media and hands-on activities created to support the development of young children's CT. The mixed-methods study included 108 families, each with a 4- or 5-year-old child. Families, who participated in the study at home for six weeks, were randomly assigned to an intervention group that viewed media and engaged with hands-on activities with a CT focus or a control group that viewed and engaged with non-STEM literacy content. Data collection consisted of parent surveys, parent interviews, and CT learning and pre-coding tasks to assess children's CT abilities. Results indicate that the learning intervention demonstrates promise in supporting parental understanding of CT. Experience with the intervention over the six weeks also appeared to cultivate some CT strategy use in children as evidenced by parental reports and performance on learning and pre-coding sequencing tasks.

AB  - This study characterizes the literature on teaching computational thinking (CT) to preschoolers aged 4 to 5 years. Previous research and published systematic studies have provided important contributions about CT teaching to elementary and high school children. However, to date, there is no systematic overview of CT education for preschoolers. For this reason, this systematic mapping synthesizes 82 studies on CT teaching, through the implementation and evaluation of tools and activities to teach, improve or measure the CT knowledge acquired by children. Furthermore, studies on courses or training offered to preschool teachers related to the teaching of CT were also considered. From the selected studies, the following information was collected: year of publication; recovery sources and databases; vehicles and places of publication; temporal delimitation of research, research approach, nature and research method; CT teaching approaches; tools used to teach CT and how they are classified according to their physical characteristics and, finally, participants and individuals responsible for the research. The results suggest an increase in the number of publications in recent years, revealing the interest of researchers in the topic. Furthermore, we observed a trend towards the use of physical artifacts and the use of the disconnected computing approach to teaching CT skills to preschool children. The results also exposed that preschool teachers have little autonomy in implementing CT teaching activities because those are mostly implemented by computer professionals (researchers, teachers, etc.). This is because preschool teachers are still discouraged from teaching computer and technology-related content to children, considering them complex and disconnected from basic curricula. However, when teachers are trained to teach CT, they become interested in the content and become more active during the teaching process. We argue for integrating CT-related content into education curricula and supporting preschool teachers to implement it autonomously in their classrooms.

AB  - This paper deals within a context where technology plays a pivotal role in education. In this sense, it is essential to highlight the emergence of new competencies and skills in education due to technological advancements. Legislative frameworks have been developed to incorporate digital literacy, access to robotics, and computational thinking, between others. Hence, this review and meta-analysis aim at identifying the influence of robotics activities on computational thinking through a PRISMA-guided review. The findings reveal that interventions conducted in early childhood education significantly impact computational thinking. Results also showcase that, despite perceived barriers related to technology accessibility, the presence of legislation and contexts prioritizing these competencies is more relevant than the digital access gap.

AB  - Since computational thinking is a high-level cognitive skill and its conceptual framework has not yet been clarified, the assessment of this skill is problematic. While there is no consensus in the literature about the components of computational thinking, the abstraction component is located at a point where opinions intersect. In addition, it is predicted that computer science unplugged activities will improve computational thinking, and there is limited research examining this effect. As a result, this research aims to demonstrate the alleged effects of computer science unplugged activities on abstraction skill which is considered the critical component of computational thinking. The study, which was planned with a mixed methods research design, lasted 8 weeks. Quantitative data were obtained from the abstraction skill test developed by the researchers, while qualitative data were obtained from observations and task- based interviews after each activity. Quantitative findings showed that computer science unplugged activities significantly improve abstraction skills and thus computational thinking. Qualitative findings not only revealed that developments in the six abstracting steps caused this significant difference but also identified abstracting steps where the effect of each activity was limited. Suggestions for organizing activities to improve these steps are given. Finally, suggestions are presented for the conceptual framework of computational thinking based on abstraction.

AB  - The healthy development of cognitive functions, including executive functions, has been shown to depend mainly on the experiences and learning opportunities of people, especially during childhood. Over the past few years, researchers have been studying the impacts of diverse types of interventions on children’s cognitive development in which computational thinking programs are a recent field. This pilot study evaluated the effect of computational thinking training based on the “Programming for Children” program on the executive functions of children aged 10 and 11 years: working memory, inhibition, and planning (N = 30). The results showed that children in the experimental group improved on tests of visuospatial working memory, cognitive inhibition, and sequential planning compared with the control group. However, tests of verbal working memory, memory strategy, and visual spatial planning did not show any observed changes. Although this was an exploratory study, and its findings should be interpreted cautiously due to the small sample size, the findings support the relevance and feasibility of conducting similar larger studies with larger samples.

AB  - Computational thinking has been promoted as an impactful 21st-century skillset that can be transferred to many other disciplines and problem scenarios. With the proliferation of age-appropriate coding platforms for young children, computational thinking has become increasingly popular in early childhood settings. However, there is a lack of research on introducing coding and computational thinking to teacher training in early childhood education. To empower early childhood teachers in the digital society, this study introduced 17 early childhood teachers to robot programming and computational thinking through the ‘CT4ECE’ professional development program, which includes three phases: Learn, Practice, and Reflect & Improve. Results of pre- and post-intervention surveys revealed that the CT4ECE program significantly enhanced teachers' robotics and pedagogical knowledge, as well as their attitudes towards computational thinking, especially their interest in and their view of using computational thinking in classroom practice. Post-intervention interviews indicated that participation in CT4ECE helped educators gain a basic understanding of both coding robots and computational thinking suitable for young children due to a structured change process for teachers' professional learning. This study establishes a strong foundation for enhancing and expanding the CT4ECE program, ultimately equipping teachers and children with the necessary skillsets to thrive in the digital future.

AB  - The purpose of the current study is to investigate the effects of the unplugged computational thinking (CT) integrated STEM (UCT-STEM) approach and STEM approach on early childhood pre-service teachers’ CT skills (creativity, algorithmic thinking, critical thinking, problem solving, cooperativity, communication). The study was conducted with a total of 70 early childhood pre-service teachers. Quasi-experimental design was used; activities based on the UCT-STEM approach were administered to the experimental group and activities based on the STEM approach were administered to the control group. Post-test scores for CT skills showed a statistically significant difference in favour of the experimental group. It was concluded that the UCT-STEM approach was more effective in developing the pre-service teachers’ CT skills than the STEM approach. The current study presents an important finding to the literature in terms of the developed STEM and UCT-STEM contents and how these contents improve pre-service teachers’ CT skills. The STEM and UCT-STEM content provides significant information in terms of teacher practices. At the same time, this study offers important implications for program developers and policy-makers to integrate these innovative educational approaches into both early childhood education and teacher education programs.

AB  - The integration of computational thinking (CT) to enhance creativity in design students has often been underexplored in design education. While design thinking has traditionally been the cornerstone of university design pedagogy and remains essential, the increasing role of digital tools and artificial intelligence in modern design practices presents new opportunities for innovation. By introducing CT alongside design thinking, students can expand their creative toolkit and engage with emerging technologies more effectively. Although many design students may have limited experience with programming, incorporating accessible, no-code tools can help them confidently embrace computational methods, unlocking new pathways for creative exploration and innovation. This study proposes an alternative approach to improve the motivation of design students by introducing machine learning tools into product design processes. We developed an experimental pedagogy in which 56 industrial design university students learned how to use Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (Weka), a machine learning tool, for three hours of design work a week, for a total of eight weeks. Our covariate analysis of data collected in the pretest and posttest shows that the general learning motivations in the group using Weka are significantly higher than those in the group without Weka. However, no significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of learning strategies, collaboration, or critical thinking. Students using Weka spent more time focusing on model training and tended to improve their algorithmic thinking, and the introduction of Weka appeared to enhance their motivation to learn. On the other hand, these students might have been focusing on working individually at their computers, potentially neglecting communication and collaboration. The findings suggest that teaching machine learning applications without requiring coding has the potential to boost design students' motivation to engage with CT skills, though care must be taken to maintain collaborative practices.

AB  - There is increasing effort to integrate Computational Thinking (CT) curricula across all education levels. Therefore, research on CT assessment has lately progressed towards developing and validating reliable CT assessment tools, which are crucial for evaluating students' potential learning progress and thus the effectiveness of suggested curricular programs. Several CT assessment tools were developed for elementary, high-school, and university students over the last years. Moreover, associations between CT scores and other cognitive abilities were unraveled. However, studies on the topic in primary school level are scarce. Like the general concept of intelligence, CT remains broadly defined as the ability to combine algorithmic operations to form complex solutions in order to solve problems effectively, utilizing concepts of computer science with or without the use of computers. In this study, we aimed at specifying a cognitive definition of CT, focusing on the under-investigated population of primary school children. Since validated assessment tools for this age group were not available, we adapted a validated CT test, which was initially designed for middle school students. In our study participated 192 third and fourth graders. The analyses revealed promising results on the reliability of the adapted CT assessment for primary school students. Moreover, findings indicated CT's positive associations with i. complex numerical abilities, ii. verbal reasoning abilities, and iii. non-verbal visuospatial abilities. Our results indicate similarities but also differences in associations of CT with other cognitive abilities in primary school children compared to other age groups. In summary: i. numerical abilities seem to associate with CT at the primary school level, whereas this seems not the case later on in education, ii. verbal abilities seem to associate with CT both along primary and secondary education levels, and iii. non-verbal reasoning abilities seem to associate with CT from primary education level to the university level and beyond. These differences imply that several basic cognitive abilities support CT abilities and CT development differentially across ages.

AB  - The concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI), born as the possibility of simulating the human brain's learning capabilities, quickly evolves into one of the educational technology concepts that provide tools for students to better themselves in a plethora of areas. Unlike the previous educational technology iterations, which are limited to instrumental use for providing platforms to build learning applications, AI has proposed a unique education laboratory by enabling students to explore an instrument that functions as a dynamic system of computational concepts. However, the extent of the implications of AI adaptation in modern education is yet to be explored. Motivated to fill the literature gap and to consider the emerging significance of AI in education, this paper aims to analyze the possible intertwined relationship between students’ intrinsic motivation for learning Artificial Intelligence during the COVID-19 pandemic; the relationship between students’ computational thinking and understanding of AI concepts; and the underlying dynamic relation, if existing, between AI and computational thinking building efforts. To investigate the mentioned relationships, the present empirical study employs mediation analysis based upon collected 137 survey data from Universidad Politécnica de Madrid students in the Institute for Educational Science and the School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering during the first quarter of 2022. Findings show that intrinsic motivation mediates the relationship between perceived Artificial Intelligence learning and computational thinking. Also, the research indicates that intrinsic motivation has a significant relationship with computational thinking and perceived Artificial Intelligence learning.

AB  - Computational thinking is widely recognized as an essential skill for adapting to the current era, with programming learning being the most effective means to develop it. It is recommended that computational thinking and learning programming be introduced as early as elementary school. However, elementary school students often possess limited prior knowledge of programming, posing challenges in their learning process. The graphic organizers (GOs) may serve as a bridge between students’ existing knowledge and new learning, facilitating a deeper processing of the overall information and thereby enhancing the learning process. This can be particularly advantageous for early-stage learners when grappling with difficult subjects. Consequently, this study employed GOs to assist elementary school students in their computational thinking and programming learning, employing a quasi-experiment design to evaluate their effectiveness. The results showed that although all students demonstrated awareness of applying computational thinking to solve problems, those exposed to GO-based instruction exhibited higher levels of computational thinking, programming skills, and flow experiences.

Few studies investigated CT practices from a development perspective. A two-year intervention was implemented in 30 intervention and 22 control schools in Hong Kong to promote CT education (T1baseline: N = 13,056; T2: N = 16,367; and T3: N = 15,269). Senior primary students (grades 4 to 6) around 8–12 years old were targeted. Among them, 34% were girls at T1baseline. Their learning progression of cognitive development was assessed with a CT practices test. Data were analyzed using item response analysis. Learning trajectories of CT practices were modeled to understand how students’ cognitive development differed between schools. Insights of findings were discussed in bringing CT practices to life.

AB  - Engagement is critical to computational thinking and programming education. However, as multi-dimensional variables, when analyzing how different aspects of engagement in computational thinking tasks influence skills development, it becomes crucial to discern precisely which engagement components intersect with the progression of computational thinking skills. This discernment is pivotal because engagement can vary based on the task nature, the context, and the individual's preferences. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the gender differences in engagement and computational thinking skills and the predictive relationships among these sub-dimensions for boys and girls in an unplugged environment. In this study, a quasi-experiment for 90 sixth-grade students from a north Chinese primary school was performed. By partial least squares–structural equation modeling, students’ models of computational thinking skills and engagement were analyzed, and comparisons of boys and girls were made by analysis of covariance statistics. Results indicated that compared with boys, girls reported higher computational thinking performance and more engagement in unplugged contexts. Furthermore, girls’ computational thinking skills were only predicted by their cognitive engagement, whereas boys’ computational thinking skills were predicted by their behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement. Teachers can adopt these findings to design computational thinking teaching interventions that combine the advantages of unplugged activity and focus on the engagement of boys and girls.

AB  - In this work, we argue for expanding the scope of K-12 computational thinking (CT) integration contexts to include everyday scenarios involving moral reasoning. Epistemic overlap between computational thinking practices and moral reasoning suggest that these contexts are potentially rich sites to see “seeds of CT” in children's reasoning and can provide rich educational pathways for children into CT. Taking a case-study approach, we examine the reasoning of a second-grader, Ollie, on a task involving fair allocation of resources to victims of a natural disaster. Our analysis finds that Ollie's reasoning was rich with seeds of CT (e.g., problem formulation, abstraction, complex-systems thinking) and that empathy served as an important supporting role to the CT. This work has implications for curricular design, suggesting that fairness and resource allocation scenarios with built-in opportunities for empathy might provide rich sandboxes for CT integration.

AB  - Although there are different definitions for computational thinking in the literature, it is possible to define it mainly as problem solving, designing and interpreting new systems by thinking like a computer. According to Wing (2006), computational thinking is a way of designing a system and understanding human behaviors by focusing on the basic concepts of the computer sciences. The recent focus on computational thinking as a key 21 st century skill for all students has led to a number of curriculum initiatives to embed it in K-12 classrooms and to introduce computing ideas to students early during their schooling years. The present study aims to explore the effects of a short, intensive coding and robotics training on the computational thinking skill self-efficacy of middle school students. 24 fifth graders participated in the study and data were collected by means of the Computational Thinking Self-efficacy scale (CTS) and one open-ended question. Analyses of the pre, post and delayed tests revealed significant differences between the pre and post-tests.

AB  - Methodological innovations across social sciences are opening new avenues for conducting research designed to address real-world challenges. The benefits of utilizing the Design-Based Implementation Research (DBIR) approach in public libraries to resolve a persistent problem of practice, a lack of assessment tools to evaluate youth Computational Thinking (CT) programs, is demonstrated. Findings from a three-year, three-phased study utilizing the DBIR approach to design and implement a suite of assessment tools to assess CT programming in public libraries are presented. Guided by the four principles of the DBIR approach, this research produced new knowledge, including identifying CT program outcomes, challenges, and recommendations for designing and implementing assessment tools to measure the impact of public libraries' CT programming. Findings underscore the DBIR approach as a strategy for engaging with practitioners and helping shift their perspectives by resolving practice problems and facilitating the design of sustainable solutions.

AB  - Although there is controversy surrounding rewards and competition in education, they are key elements in digital game-based learning (DGBL). Research on the influence of rewards and competition in DGBL often yields mixed results, suggesting a need to investigate individual game elements and their interactions. This study implemented DGBL focusing on computational thinking (CT) in 7th-grade classes. Both quantitative and behavioral data were collected to understand the impact of rewards (power-up or customization) and competition (with or without) on students’ intrinsic motivation, game performance, behaviors, and CT skills. The findings uncovered significant interactions between rewards and competition. Students with both competition and power-up rewards achieved the highest game points but the lowest CT performance, whereas those exposed to the same power-up rewards without competition attained the lowest game points but the best CT performance. Implications are drawn for DGBL research and practice.

AB  - Despite growing interest in early childhood computational thinking (CT), there is a lack of validated assessments for children who are emerging readers. This paper presents validity and reliability evidence of a performance-based assessment of CT using item response theory (IRT) from 272 children aged 4–8. Using a two-parameter logistic model IRT model (2PL IRT), we confirmed that model- and item-level fits are acceptable. Item analyses revealed a high discriminability (M = 2.26, SD = 1.12) and a moderate item difficulty (M = −0.21; SD = 0.86), on average, across 19 items. Reliability analysis demonstrated that the assessment was substantially reliable (marginal reliability: rxx = 0.87). Differential item functioning (DIF) analyses indicated that the assessment estimated children's item parameters fairly, regardless of their gender and age. However, we confirmed gaps in latent ability (θ) of CT by gender and age: boys showed higher latent ability of CT than girls, and old children (above 72 months) showed higher latent ability than young children (below 72 months). Findings suggest the assessment is a fair measure that can serve as a reliable and valid tool to assess CT for children who are emerging readers.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is an important and essential skill for human beings to master in the 21st century. Although CT has received wide attention since this concept was proposed, the current theoretical models have not well defined the complex relations between CT and other cognitive abilities for young children. To provide insight into this gap, the current study proposed a model in which we hypothesized that CT was significantly related to arithmetic fluency that is viewed as an important domain of mathematics. Additionally, arithmetic fluency was predicted to mediate the relations of CT to other cognitive abilities, including reasoning and creativity. This study tested such direct and indirect relations in children aged 5–6 years. Consistent with previous studies on older age groups, the results showed that CT and arithmetic fluency were significantly related to each other and both were significantly related to reasoning ability and creative thinking as well. Moreover, this study, for the first time, indicated that arithmetic fluency totally mediated the relation between CT and reasoning ability, suggesting that these concepts share conceptual commonalities, such as the cognitive processes related to mathematics or/and abstraction; in contrast, arithmetic fluency did not mediate the relation between CT and creative thinking, suggesting that gaining CT skill may exert direct positive effect on the development of creativity. Therefore, despite the root in computer science, CT is associated with many cognitive and learning abilities in other domains, supporting the importance of including CT into early school education.

Learning games offer the potential for innovative, stealth assessments of students' implicit learning from gameplay behaviors. This paper reports on the measurement of implicit CT practices demonstrated by upper elementary- and middle-school students as they play the CT learning game Zoombinis. The process of using the gameplay log data to build valid automated detectors of students' implicit CT practices is discussed. Findings from this study provide implications for analyzing gameplay behaviors at scale, leading to the development of models for the assessment of implicit STEM learning.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is critical for Twenty-first century life. Ensuring equitable access to CT depends on preparing teachers to integrate CT into disciplinary curricula. We report on the design, evaluation, and outcomes of the Computational Thinking Unplugged for Science (CT-UP-S) professional development program for inservice science teachers. Our process-based approach to CT significantly improved teachers CT understanding and CT/science integration self-efficacy by systematically linking CT practices to scaffold the generation of unplugged algorithms. Additionally, we found that the process-based approach provided a framework for teachers' lesson planning and that teachers’ content knowledge moderated their ability to write CT-integrated science lessons.

AB  - Early evidence suggests that robot programming offers an important foundation for spatial reasoning and computational thinking; however, researchers have debated how to introduce young children to these skills. We explored how preschoolers develop understanding of spatial concepts and computational thinking as the children took turns navigating a path during guided play with a programmable robot. Our analysis of the data included a multimodal visualization of the exchanges between the teacher, children, and a programmable robotic device. The findings highlight the effects that arose from the physical-digital convergence of technology integrated into play including: (a) the robot evoked a chain of actions, enacting pedagogic forces that transformed children's learning; (b) children used their own bodies as spatial referents, co-locating themselves in space with the robot; (c) the teacher remained a key actor, providing verbal and nonverbal scaffolding to promote children's understanding and mastery of spatial and computational concepts; and (d) talking with the teacher about spatial concepts combined with the interactions with the robot enhanced children's acquisition of spatial ideas relative to the quantity of children's verbal expressions and complexity of their applied spatial skills and computational thinking.

AB  - Workers in the areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics play a significant role in the sustained growth and stability of the global economy, and, thus constitute a critical component in helping all countries worldwide to prosper. In this context, computational thinking constitutes an important skill to have as it enables workers to develop creative solutions to complex problems. Nonetheless, across all economies worldwide, there is a need to have more workers who are able to think through problems, challenges, and solutions in computational terms. It is thus of utmost importance to integrate the teaching of computational thinking in K-12 education in order to reduce the skills gap between education and the workplace. A pertinent and crucial question that arises is whether teachers have the knowledge and skills to teach students how to think computationally. Existing research shows that teacher education departments do not currently have the knowledge to promote computational thinking in their programs. The present study focuses on two aspects of computational thinking, such as, algorithmic thinking and debugging skills with the use of scaffolded programming scripts in an educational technology undergraduate course. The results show statistically significant learning gains in pre-service teachers’ algorithmic thinking and debugging skills in the context of robotic programming activities with LEGO WeDo. Limitations and future research directions are discussed.

AB  - Recent studies identify Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) as a key factor in enhancing cognitive development, particularly within Computational Thinking (CT) literature. However, research gaps remain in understanding how SRL and CT interact from a developmental perspective. Our study designed a program with tailored animations and worksheets to specifically foster students' learning and cognitive development. Using a mixed-methods approach, we administered surveys among 1235 students from 29 Hong Kong primary schools to investigate a dynamic learning system comprising SRL and CT in a large-scale CT program. Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 students to further probe insights. Quantitative findings revealed a mutually reinforcing relationship in the dynamic system, suggesting that higher SRL skills enhance cognitive CT abilities, and vice versa. Complementing these results, qualitative findings showed that integrating animations and worksheets into the CT program significantly boosted students' SRL and cognitive development. These findings have significant implications for educational practices and curriculum design. Schools should consider implementing SRL strategies, such as proactive goal setting and reflective evaluation, within their curricula to promote students’ cognitive development. Furthermore, strategic investments in educational technology, including collaborations with EdTech developers, are essential to create effective, pedagogically sound tools that enhance learning outcomes. These insights provide valuable guidance for creating a supportive SRL environment that fosters cognitive development in primary school education.

AB  - In recent years, there has been increasing interest in integrating Computational Thinking (CT) into elementary schools. However, few studies have focused on teachers’ perceptions. This study aims to examine teachers' perceptions to bridge the gap between theory and practice. The study analysed teachers’ perceptions of integrating CT into school subjects through the constructionist approach, using Scratch a leading programming platform inspired by Resnick's Lifelong Kindergarten Constructionist model. Over a school year, 31 teachers participated in a professional development program and applied this model in their classrooms. The teachers were interviewed to capture their perceptions of learning and teaching using a constructionist method. The findings revealed that teachers with creative arts experience fully embraced the model, while others partially adopted it. Teachers recognized the benefits of constructionist teaching in fostering creativity, motivation, and engagement among students. However, they struggled with balancing these benefits with school demands and constraints. Challenges included managing time effectively within constraints of school and ensuring curriculum alignment. Despite this, many teachers found that the constructionist approach positively impacted students' learning engagement and personal development. By addressing the identified challenges, teacher education designers, curriculum developers, and schools can develop practices for closing the gap between theory and practice.

AB  - Educational research on predicting learners’ computer programming performance has yielded practical implications that guide task designs in computer education. There have been attempts to investigate learners’ computer programming patterns using high-frequency and automated data collection. This approach can be considered as process-based analysis as opposed to outcome-based analysis (i.e., the use of test or exam scores). In this process-based approach to investigate learners’ computer programming process, we included two critical constructs in our research, self-regulated learning and computational thinking skills. We aimed to identify learners’ computer programming patterns in the context that novice students learn a computer programming language, Python, in an online coding environment. We examined the relationships between the learners’ coding patterns, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills. Initially, we adopted a traditional approach with the aggregate data of learners’ computer programming behaviors. We then utilized a computational analytics approach to learner performance, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills, with ever-changing computer programming patterns. In our initial approach, the indicators of aggregate computer programming data were not associated with learners' learning performance and computational thinking skills. In the computational analysis approach, many indicators revealed significant differences between the identified patterns regarding computational thinking skills and self-regulated learning. Recommendations about the use of programming log data analysis methods and future scaffolding for computer programming learners are addressed.

AB  - In the field of education, research has consistently emphasized mathematical creative thinking as a crucial component of 21st-century skills. Thus, this cross-sectional study examines the predictors of such thinking by specifically focusing on the roles of perceived creativity, creative self-efficacy, and computational thinking. The participants consisted of 896 secondary school students (52.9 % female; 47.1 % male) in Indonesia who were asked to complete a series of online questionnaires and tests. For analysis, structural equation modeling was employed, demonstrating satisfactory construct validity and instrument reliability. Based on the results, there was a positive association between computational thinking and mathematical creative thinking. In addition, perceived creativity had a positive impact on mathematical creative thinking, whereas creative self-efficacy showed a negative association. As for the empirical model, it revealed that computational thinking plays a mediating role, connecting perceived creativity and creative self-efficacy to mathematical creative thinking. The findings suggest that incorporating these skills and related variables into the mathematics curriculums in schools is essential for preparing students for success in the 21st century.

AB  - Previous studies have explored the relationship between computational thinking (CT) and creativity. However, a consensus has yet to be reached since both CT and creativity varied in ideation and assessment. To uncover the cognitive mechanism underlying the interplay between CT and creativity, we conduct a scoping review of 26 empirical studies published in 2006–2024. Our findings suggested that the effects of working memory varied in the interplay between CT and creativity due to differences in age range, neural network activation regions, and measurements. Intellectual abilities, including algorithmic fluency, reasoning ability, and coding ability, showed cognitive transfer effect on CT skills but not necessarily on creativity, suggesting that cognitive abilities embracing more intelligent elements may contribute to the functional connectivity in CT neural networks but only partly overlapped with creativity involved networks. Although executive functions (working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control) play a crucial role in both CT and creativity, their contributions to the CT-creativity interplay are still rarely studied. Future research should explore the CT-creativity relationship from the perspective of neuroscience.

AB  - This systematic review examined how computer science (CS) education was implemented in schools and its efficacy for developing students’ computational thinking (CT). Sixty-six papers were selected for this systematic review and analyzed for patterns in relation to the implementation of CS education in K-12 schools and its impact on the development of students’ CT skills. Although educational interventions have not always been successful in CS education, this review provides strong evidence that overall, CS education promotes the development of students’ CT in the K-12 setting while improving their creative and critical thinking skills. We recommend early access to CS education, various innovative instructional approaches to CS education and appropriate support and guidance for student learning.

AB  - Recently, the development of computational thinking (CT) skills has become widespread in the whole world. There is a consensus to develop students’ CT skills through unplugged and plugged-in programming. However, the choice of programming approaches taught in schools is arbitrary and few studies have compared the effectiveness differences between unplugged and plugged-in programming. This study aimed to explore the differences between unplugged and plugged-in programming in developing CT skills of students in Grades 1-2 students. It also explored the joint effects of students’ gender, programming experience, programming interest, and programming confidence with different programming approaches on CT skills. The quasi-experimental research approach was used to conduct 10 weeks of unplugged, plugged-in, and regular programming activities with 124 Grades 1-2 students. The results found that unplugged programming promoted CT skills more in the early primary grades than plugged-in programming. We found that boys and students with programming experience in unplugged group performed significantly better in CT skills than in plugged-in group. Moreover, the improvement of CT skills of students in unplugged group was positively correlated with the level of their programming interest and programming confidence. However, these were not observed in plugged-in group. The results of this study can provide precise guidance for teaching CT skills to early primary school students and provide references for CT education.

AB  - This paper presents an investigation that compares and analyzes the interactions of three groups of pre-and-primary school children with three different storytelling systems. We identify emerging patterns through which they engaged in what we refer to as narrative computational thinking. The latter describes broadened aspects of narrative literacy practices that are linked to computational thinking. By applying a multicase study approach and through various vignettes, we illustrate how children applied computational thinking to understand and influence the narrative possibilities offered by the different tools. Our results illustrate circumstances under which digital storytelling activities provide a favorable basis for narrative computational thinking, and that when computational thinking functions as a scaffold for story creation, it encourages a blend of creativity and computational thinking, providing a compelling approach to introducing emerging digital literacies to young children in a narrative context.

AB  - In this study, it is aimed to identify the computational thinking skills used by gifted and talented students in integrated STEM activities based on the EDP. The case study design, a qualitative research method, is employed in the study. The participants consist of gifted and talented students attending the Science and Arts Center. Integrated STEM activities based on the EDP were conducted over the course of ten weeks and among these activities, robotic and 3D modeling-based robot construction activities using Lego sets are addressed in the present study. The STEM activity booklet, researchers' fieldnotes, and teaching process video recordings were used as data collection tools in the study. Data that was collected was analyzed through content analysis. It was seen that gifted and talented students participating in integrated STEM activities based on the EDP make active use of critical thinking skills while providing explanations, making associations, questioning information, giving justifications, solving problems, thinking creatively, making generalizations, and attempting to convince others; as for the instances of defining problems, creating solutions, and evaluating the effectiveness of the solution, the students were observed to actively use their problem-solving skills. The detailed account provided by the study on the way robotic and 3D robot modeling activities improve the computational thinking skills of gifted and talented students contributes to the required educational support and to the existing body of literature.

AB  - In the artificial intelligence age, cultivating young children's computational thinking (CT) has sparked tremendous attention. Programmable robotics is a developmental-appropriate and screen-free means that provides young children with great opportunities to learn programming and develop CT. However, it is reported that young children might have difficulties learning abstract CT concepts. As a helpful pedagogical facilitator, metaphors can help turn abstract concepts into more concrete and clear concepts that learners are familiar with. Therefore, this research proposed a metaphor-based robot programming (MRP) approach and explored its impact on young children's CT and behavioral patterns. A total of 118 children aged 5–6 were recruited in this experiment with two conditions: the experimental group adopted the metaphor-based robot programming (MRP) approach while the control group used the conventional robot programming (CRP) approach. Results revealed that children who adopted the MRP approach outperformed children who adopted the CRP approach on CT. In addition, behavioral analysis indicated that the proposed MRP approach could facilitate children's superior learning performance and more positive learning behaviors, so as to help them achieve learning objectives. Accordingly, this study can provide insightful guidance and inspiration for future research on effective programming teaching and CT development for young children.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is a necessary skill for students. It is as important as the other essential skills such as reading, writing, and arithmetic. However, how to improve students’ CT in robotics is still to be explored. Hence, this study examined the effects of computer supported project-based learning (CSPBL) on students’ CT and learning engagement through comparing students’ CT and engagement in two courses instructed by the same instructor (one instructed with a traditional method, the other instructed with CSPBL). Participants were seventy-nine students from a university in China. Questionnaires, interviews, and project analysis were used to measure students’ CT and learning engagement. The comparative results of self-reports and final projects indicated that the CSPBL enhanced students’ CT. The simulation project training based on the SenseStudy learning platform in CSPBL helped students debug the programming code, optimize the algorithm design, and improve their algorithmic thinking, cooperation, and problem solving during the program error correction. The CSPBL also improved students’ engagement in learning, especially for those with more than one year of programming experience. It was found that the CSPBL was effective in terms of improving students’ CT and engagement in robotics learning. This study provides teachers with practical suggestions to conduct effective robotics instruction.

AB  - Malaysia has introduced computational thinking skills as part of a curriculum integration update to meet the global trends in 21st-century education, focusing on empowering digital literacy. Nevertheless, a preliminary investigation revealed an apparent lack of understanding of computational thinking skills in general among teachers. The study explores the feasibility of developing a localized E-learning system to train computational thinking skills among teachers. An E-learning system, termed as myCTGWBL, was developed on the basis of a newly proposed conceptual framework to present computational thinking teaching–learning repertoire to the teachers. The hypothesis is that myCTGWBL would develop teachers' computational thinking and its position in teaching–learning understanding. myCTGWBL relevance was tested through DeLone and McLean's information system and Urbach's collaboration quality construct. To determine the success factors, partial least squares structural equation modeling was used. A total of 369 teachers participated in a two-stage survey. Participants' understanding of computational thinking and perceptions were recorded at the pre- and post-intervention phases. Open-ended questions of the surveys were analyzed using a simple text analysis technique. The closed-ended questions surveys were analyzed using SPSS Statistics 22.0. A significant improvement in teachers' computational thinking teaching–learning repertoire in a relatively short period has been recorded. Teachers also demonstrated increased confidence in the future delivering computational thinking-based lessons. The E-learning conceptual framework has illustrated the predictive power between user intent, user satisfaction, and Computational thinking (CT) knowledge benefits. Results demonstrate that myCTGWBL could be used to guide future planning when establishing CT knowledge acquisition initiatives, particularly among teachers.

AB  - Efforts to incorporate computational thinking (CT) into academic courses have been gaining popularity. CT is a problem-solving skill that is crucial in the 21st century. CT may be used to support language education. Courses in English as a foreign language often need an effective writing component that includes writing organization and language use, as demonstrated by the poor writing samples often generated by students of these courses. To address the problems, CT, which is a higher-order mode of problem-solving and knowledge acquisition optimization, was used. The experimental group was instructed using the CT teaching model based on CT's essential components (decomposition, generalization, abstraction, algorithm, and evaluation), whereas the control group was taught using the conventional method. In total, 58 undergraduate students divided into two groups participated in this study. A combination of writing, CT skills, surveys, and interviews were used to collect data according to an experimental design. The collected quantitative data were analyzed through analysis of covariance and structural equation modeling, and the MAXQDA 2022software was used to analyze the collected qualitative data. The results of this study indicate that incorporating CT into an English writing course enhances the writing and higher-order thinking skills of students. The CT concepts helps students develop critical thinking skills by evaluating the text and identifying potential issues or improvements. Additionally, it allows students to use their skills to create unique writing solutions, which can boost English writing creativity.

AB  - Computational thinking education has become an increasingly popular topic among practitioners and researchers. However, rare is known how to effectively teach and learn computational thinking in early childhood education. To address this knowledge gap, this systematic review examined 26 studies on the teaching and learning of computational thinking in early childhood education from 2010 to 2022. The content knowledge, tools, pedagogical design, assessment methods, and learning outcomes were analyzed. Results indicated that, with age-appropriate instructional design, children could develop early concepts and skills of computational thinking, as well as other related skills such as communication, collaboration, and problem solving. Across the studies, we found that most studies used quantitative research methods, with direct assessment and observation being the most. Several challenges were identified: (1) achieving a deeper learning of computational thinking; (2) a lack of valid and reliable computational thinking assessments for children with a wider age range; (3) selecting appropriate learning tools; and (4) designing age-appropriate activities for young learners. Although with these challenges, computational thinking education could bring new learning opportunities and enhance children's computational thinking skills, as well as other non-cognitive skills such as critical thinking, body-material interaction, and hand-eye coordination. This systematic review informs future endeavors in theorizing a digital learning framework that can integrate computational thinking into early childhood education.

AB  - Teacher competencies encompass the dimensions of knowledge and attitudes, yet few studies have analysed teachers' latent profiles in relation to the interaction between these two dimensions. Latent profile analysis, which examines the interplay between variables to distinguish subgroups of individuals, has recently emerged in studies of computational thinking (CT) as a method for identifying student profiles. However, the latent profiles of CT teachers have not yet been analysed. We therefore analysed the latent profiles of a sample of 493 teachers who had participated in a teacher development programme in CT, according to their knowledge and perceived usefulness of CT. Three profiles were identified: (1) highly knowledgeable with high perceived usefulness, (2) knowledgeable with low perceived usefulness, and (3) less knowledgeable with low perceived usefulness. Qualitative data further triangulated these findings. We also examined the learning achievement of 12,105 students taught by these teachers. Students taught by highly knowledgeable teachers with a high perceived sense of usefulness demonstrated significantly better achievement than their peers. Our findings highlight the importance of nurturing both knowledge of and perceived usefulness in CT. They also provide valuable insights for similar teacher development programmes, emphasizing the importance of peer mentoring support for less knowledgeable teachers. Additionally, we underscore the value of having teachers create artefacts using CT for instructional purposes, allowing them to gain firsthand experience of its usefulness. As few studies have explored teachers' latent profiles based on the dimensions of knowledge and attitudes, the contribution of this study extends beyond the domain of CT.

AB  - We designed a controlled trial protocol that seeks to contribute to cognitive science by studying the effect of thought training on children's executive functions. The study design is a cluster randomized controlled trial, with intra-subject and inter-subject evaluation, with two parallel groups: an experimental group and a TAU control group. With three measures, pre-test, post-test, and follow-up after three months. The participants will be children aged 9 to 11. The allocation will be randomized by groups and not individually. The sample will be a minimum of 44 participants. The primary measures will be neuropsychological tests to assess executive functions. Secondary measures will be a computational thinking test, neuropsychological tests to assess metacognition and attention, and an acceptability scale. The experimental group will participate in the COGNI-MACHINE computational thinking training designed by the first author. The training frequency will be twice a week in 60 min sessions for 12 weeks. The TAU control group will receive computer science classes as usual during the same time as the experimental group. The evaluators taking the measurements will be blinded to the assignment. The investigators in charge of the intervention will be blinded to the results of the evaluations.

AB  - Negative feedback can temporarily relieve negative Chinese transfer (NCT) in English as a foreign language (EFL) syntactic writing by focusing only on the surface writing constructs, neglecting that EFL writing is an embodiment of the process by which higher-order thinking operates. To solve the problem, the researchers conducted a pretest, interventionist group dynamic assessment (IGDA) in the form of negative feedback based on computational thinking (CT), higher-order thinking, and post-test quasi-experimental design, with a control group receiving the direct correction feedback instructing model to mitigate the NCT in EFL syntactic writing. We analyzed the syntactic writing types and frequencies of the NCT obtained through repeated-measure ANOVA and confirmed by qualitative data through video recording. The results indicated that IGDA in the form of negative feedback based on CT principal skills could (1) significantly decrease syntactic writing errors caused by the NCT, (2) improve learners’ EFL writing performance, and finally, (3) elevate the computer as an essential mediation tool. This innovative instructing mode of intervening with writing constructs and higher-order thinking and bringing about deeper thinking and creativity contributes to the EFL writing teaching methodology in a foreign language higher education.

AB  - The tenure system in the United States places significant importance on teaching effectiveness. To date, students' evaluations of teaching (SETs) have been the reigning mechanism for assessing effective teaching. However, prior work has shown that SETs are often biased against underrepresented groups and minorities. The present study analyzes options for effective teaching assessments, which include evaluating final grades and measuring the differences between students’ pre- and post-tests (normalized gain) using standard instruments. The content area and the instrument used in this study originated in the computational thinking field, which has a widespread presence in engineering, where minorities are at a disadvantage. This study obtained a total of 88 student participants from four sections of an introductory engineering course at a Southwestern institution. The study utilized a computational thinking diagnostic (CTD) to inform the course teaching approach (the intervention). Results show that (a) normalized learning gains correlated moderately with SETs, (b) final grades correlated strongly with SETs, (c) final grades correlated strongly with normalized learning gains, (d) the educational intervention based on the CTD significantly affected student learning, and (e) SET comments affect evaluations. The implications include the notion that standardized instrument-driven instruction and evaluations can increase the success of minorities on both sides of the classroom. The purpose of this manuscript is to invite the Heliyon readership to get involved in the development of related instruments and to incorporate these measures of learning into their instruction so biases are avoided or minimized.

AB  - In the digital age, our lives become more dependent on technology, yet the digital gap is intensifying especially because most people lack digital literacy. As a modest step to handle this challenge, we designed a course named "Play with me in Code" to develop pre-service teachers' (PSTs) thinking skills and expose them to learning by creation using computational thinking and programming as part of the constructionism paradigm. The added value of using Scratch in the context of teacher education lies not only in familiarity with a programming language but with an emphasis on experiencing self-directed learning tackling with problem solving situations, creativity, socioemotional competencies, and logical computational thinking. The present study aims to examine 25 PSTs' attitudes towards facing challenges of coding with Scratch. To this end, a mixed-method approach was activated by using questionnaires, blog posts, and reflections. Findings revealed that the learning environment encouraged PSTs' use of abstraction and decomposition to address a complex problem or to design a complex game. Study's conclusions relate to the importance of providing PSTs opportunities to experience learning by programming for raising their awareness of the importance of enhancing thinking skills and creativity in the future.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT), a way to think about solving problems, is recognized as a basic skill for the 21st century. Although game-based learning (GBL) has been shown to improve student's CT skills, students may fail to self-evaluate or debate as they play games, thus failing to develop higher-order thinking. Also not widely explored is how teachers are to practice the CT core competencies during the learning process to cultivate students' problem-solving thinking. As the adoption of student-generated questions (SGQ) is an instructional strategy to promote higher-order thinking, we develop a GBL platform that uses this strategy to enhance students' CT skills, learning motivation, and learning confidence. For this purpose, fifty-three primary school students were recruited for this study, and data were collected during four classes of experimental CT activities. This study shows that the experimental group using the SGQ strategy with a GBL platform exhibited significantly higher CT skills than the control group. In addition, with respect to learning motivation and learning confidence it is found that the experimental group also outperformed the control group. This confirms that integrating the SGQ strategy and CT core competencies fosters higher-order cognitive thinking in students in problem-solving through gamification of the learning environment, resulting in higher motivation and confidence to complete experimental activities.

In this paper, we describe our (1) integrated STEM and computational thinking (CT) teacher preparation program; (2) response to barriers educators face in preparing students to critically use computing principles; and (3) examples of the pedagogical practices teacher candidates developed through the program. We contribute an approach to preparing and empowering educators to support students understanding and use of CT as a lens for advocating for social justice in their lives.

AB  - To effectively utilize artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies such as ChatGPT and realize their novel ethical issues, individuals must have a variety of knowledge and skills about AI. Such knowledge and skills have led to the emergence of AI literacy. Despite the importance of AI literacy in everyday life, little is known about its determinants. To better understand the determinants of AI literacy, we attempted to build a research model relying on previous research and different theoretical frameworks. The model incorporated digital divide, cognitive absorption, and computational thinking. As a major finding from the current study, computational thinking was found to be a significant determinant of AI literacy, which facilitate using, recognizing, and evaluating AI-based technologies. Moreover, we found out that individuals with physical access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) are more expected to use and recognize AI. Also, motivation and skills in using ICTs enable individuals to better evaluate the outcomes of AI-based technologies. The findings also showed that convenient access to ICTs contributes to a deep involvement with AI-based technologies in the use. Further, individuals with higher motivation and skills to use AI technologies are likely to have a pleasant experience after using these technologies.

AB  - Both computational thinking (CT) and creativity have been recognized as key skills for today's learners. Over the last decade, research of both skills in a single context has emerged. In this paper, we present a scoping review of 62 such empirical from 2011 to 2020. Our goal was to have a thorough understanding of the educational settings in which research on both CT and creativity was conducted, the theoretical foundations it has laid down, and the research tools used. Our findings indicate a geographical bias (dominance of the US and prominence of developed European countries), as well as a focus on secondary education and on STEM-related disciplines; this could be explained by the current situation of CT spread. We also found that when studying CT and creativity jointly, it is most common to define CT in a broader perspective than merely programming of computer science. Additionally, while creativity is largely referred to as product-related, CT is barely referred to as such. Taken together, our findings point out some gaps in the current research of CT and creativity and suggest how it should be expended on the fertile grounds of creativity, as the latter crosses geographical, age, and subject borders. Doing so may build a bridge between CT and creativity in a way that will benefit both.

AB  - This paper sheds light on 3–5-year-old children’s enactments of computational empowerment (CE) in activities with computational thinking (CT). CT is widely elaborated on as a universal problem-solving approach and a skill set necessary for thriving in today’s digitized societies. Scholars claim that CT for all should be ensured from an early age, and several studies develop and examine age-appropriate technological tools, as well as pedagogical approaches, for young children’s learning of CT. Based on 1.5 years of co-designing for children’s situated CT in two Danish kindergartens, the present study conducts a socioculturally informed analysis of video-observed interactions between children and educational robots. The findings display how children and robots engage in interactions that transcend children’s mastery of CT in any narrow sense. This is examined as situated enactments of CE; as children’s critical and informed decisions regarding the roles that technologies, in this case educational robots, can play in their institutionally situated social lives. The paper concludes that children’s various enactments of CE deserve scholarly and professional attention, both as an important prerequisite for, and as a necessary limitation to, the implementation of CT in kindergartens.

AB  - Since the end of the 20th century, the digitalization of society, including the educational systems, has been growing exponentially. At the same time, education systems have been evolving towards competency-based assessment. Likewise, at the beginning of this century, the idea of Computational Thinking was resurrected by J. Wing, for solving problems and designing systems using concepts of computer science. Today, we can see how all these questions are taking shape in a new competence, called Computational Thinking, related to others that already exist. In this paper, we have studied the skills of Computational Thinking in university students, focusing on abstraction and its possible relationship with other factors. Results conclude that the students fail in relation to abstraction and in algorithmic thinking. Although the ability of abstraction is not easy to measure, a linear regression analysis has been carried out in order to determine its possible study.

AB  - Teaching computational thinking (CT) has become a priority for educators and policymakers tasked with educating and training students for future jobs which are predicted to be increasingly automated. Recent research on effective instructional interventions for developing computational thinking skills, including algorithmic and critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity, and cooperativity, suggests that teaching and learning CT can improve student academic performance. In fact, the extant literature is quite sanguine about the topic of CT. However, few studies have attempted to establish a relationship between CT skills and academic performance. In the present cross-sectional study, we employ path analysis to model the structural relationship between self-reported CT skills and academic performance of a sample of 81 computer science undergraduates enrolled at a Southwestern American university. We found few direct relationships between CT skills and academic performance. We only find a significant positive relationship between creativity and academic performance and a significant negative relationship between cooperativity and academic performance. Our findings are surprising considering the abundant research promoting computational thinking as a key component of 21st century skills. The findings call for further in-depth analysis of computational thinking and the influence on students’ learning and learning outcomes. We discuss our results with respect to recent educational mandates for including CT and instructional alignment in school curricula. Our findings contribute to the existing discussion by helping to clarify the relationship between CT skills and academic performance in higher education.

AB  - Although studies have shown that computational thinking (CT) can enhance learning processes and outcomes across traditional subjects, they have not shown how teachers might scaffold children's CT processes in a technology-mediated learning context. This exploratory study examined how teacher talk and technologies impacted the CT of three children (6 to 8 years old). Seven videotaped 90-minute sessions of weekly project-based activities yielded 4,842 turns of talk (2,974 by children). Statistical discourse analysis revealed the following results. After a teacher command, the children more often executed a sequence of actions toward a solution but less often demonstrated problem understanding than otherwise. Following a teacher's open question, the children were more likely to offer logically organized ideas. In response to a teacher's rhetorical question, they more often searched for information. These results inform educators regarding when to use each type of teacher talk to scaffold children's CT processes.

AB  - ChatGPT (generative pre-trained transformer) is one of the artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that have started to be used in programming education. However, the effect of using ChatGPT in programming education on learning processes and outcomes is not yet known. This study investigated the effect of programming education using the ChatGPT on students' computational thinking skills, programming self-efficacy, and motivation toward the lesson. The research was conducted on 45 undergraduate students who took a university-level programming course. The research was carried out according to the experimental design with the pretest-posttest control group. Students were randomly divided into experimental (n = 21) and control (n = 24) groups. While the experimental group students benefited from the ChatGPT during the weekly programming practices, the control group students did not use this tool. Research data were obtained through the computational thinking scale, computer programming self-efficacy scale, and learning motivation in computer programming courses scale. Research findings revealed that the experimental group students' computational thinking skills, programming self-efficacy, and motivation for the lesson were significantly higher than the control group students. In line with this result, it can be said that it may be useful to benefit from AI technologies such as ChatGPT in programming trainings. The research findings, it was emphasized how the most effective use of AI support in the lessons could be made, and various suggestions were made for researchers and educators in this regard.

AB  - In this paper, we explore how the theoretical notion of possibility space offers a way to study how children's computational thinking develops as a process. Drawing on embodied notions of cognition, we first examine the literature that supports how children's computational thinking emerges as a possibility space that involves conceptualizing possible actions in a given moment, deciding which action to take by anticipating the results of a possible action, and learning from the actions that they have taken. We then use a grounded approach to analyze the problem-solving process of two 5th-grade children who engaged in an educational robotics activity over two 50-minute class periods. The findings lend support for approaching children's computational thinking as a cycle of action-taking that includes conceptualizing, anticipating, and taking action. The findings also support the pedagogical practice of having children predict the results of a computer program to enhance their computational thinking. Implications for the way that teachers can support children in learning to conceptualize what is possible and take action from it are discussed.

AB  - Predictive learner modelling is crucial for personalized education. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great success in education, their potential in learner modelling via image data is unexplored. This research introduces a novel and interpretable approach for Image-based Learner Modelling (ImageLM) using CNNs and transfer learning to model learners’ performance and accordingly classify their computational thinking solutions. The approach integrates Grad-CAM, enabling it to provide insights into its decision-making process. Findings show that our custom CNN outperforms other models (namely ResNet, VGG, and Inception), with 83% accuracy in predicting solution correctness. More importantly, the ImageLM approach identifies the regions that contribute the most to the predictions, shedding light on learners' computational thinking knowledge and advancing toward trustworthy AI for education. These results underline the potential of utilizing imagery data from learners’ activities during the learning process to predict their performance, especially in challenging environments like programming where traditional feature extraction and learning might struggle.

AB  - The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has led to the proliferation of computational thinking (CT) education. However, research on unplugged activities’ influence in elementary math classrooms is limited, despite some exploring programming's cognitive benefits. This study presents both qualitative and quantitative analyzes stemming from a ten-week quasi-experimental research endeavor, specifically tailored for third-grade students. The research devised a series of unplugged activities, encompassing mathematical games, hands-on construction of mathematical logic boards, and calculating shopping discounts. The overarching objective was to investigate the impact of these unplugged activities on students’ mathematical creativity and CT. Students participating in a mathematics curriculum based on unplugged activities (N = 47) were compared with students participating in a traditional lecture-based mathematics curriculum (N = 46). The results indicated that unplugged activities exhibited significant advantages in fostering students’ CT and mathematical creativity across three dimensions, namely, problem-posing creativity (t = 5.830, p < 0.01), problem-solving creativity (t = 6.633, p < 0.01), and creative self-efficacy (t = 7.554, p < 0.01). Furthermore, the study revealed a relationship between students’ mathematical creativity as a predictor of CT. The results of the quantitative analysis were supported by the teacher's and students’ interview data, and the students felt excited and interested in the unplugged activities, whereas some students using the lecture-based method reported boredom and lack of interactivity. This research offered valuable insights for mathematics and CT education practice, underscoring unplugged activity as an innovative instructional approach that brings forth new possibilities for traditional mathematics teaching, with potential applications in the K-12 curriculum.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has received worldwide attention due to its alignment with developing 21st century skills such as creativity, problem-solving, and digital competence. With the increasing provision of programming tools such as robotic toys and tablet apps in the sector of early childhood education (ECE), many ECE researchers and practitioners tend to link CT to programming. However, children are reluctant to sustain their interests in programming activities, and may be further demotivated by debugging failures. This multi-group quasi-experimental study aimed to evaluate the effects of a story-inspired approach in bridging the gap between programming and CT for preschool children. Building on previous literature suggesting storytelling as a powerful, culturally responsive pedagogy, 5-year-old children (N=108) were involved in nine weeks of CT learning via one of the three conditions: Story-Inspired Robot Programming (SIRP), Story-Inspired Tablet Programming (SITP), and unplugged CT education. Results revealed that children who participated in the SIRP and SITP conditions showed improved CT scores, relative to unplugged CT education, even after controlling for baseline CT scores. No gender or family socioeconomic effects were found to influence the benefits of story-inspired programming interventions. These findings suggest that storytelling as a culturally responsive approach, whether using robots or tablets as a programming tool, can provide young children with more inclusive and sustainable CT learning experiences.

AB  - Content area K-12 teachers are increasingly asked to integrate computing and computational thinking into their classrooms, yet they often have little experience with computing. The purpose of this study was to understand how science teachers, new to computing and integrating computational thinking into their classrooms, supported students as computational problem solvers. In the project from which this research was drawn, 8th grade science teachers in three US school districts integrated computer game design into their study of climate systems and climate change. We conducted participant observation, collected teacher implementation logs and interviewed 15 teachers engaged in the three-year design research project, Building Systems from Scratch. Analysis through grounded theory yielded several results related to teachers’ orientations, strategies, and use of resources to create systems of distributed expertise. We identified five major themes: a) releasing responsibility to students, b) co-learning with students, c) encouraging students’ independent problem solving, d) building interdependence among students, and e) providing multiple other resources. Findings are discussed in relation to the literature on integrating computational thinking into content area classrooms.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is currently used as an umbrella term in education to describe the processes associated with learning and applying computer science concepts and strategies for problem-solving. Despite a growing body of literature on the subject within education and the development of a grand variety of tools designed to enhance computational thinking abilities, the relations between CT and other cognitive abilities have not been reported in young children. Understanding CT from a cognitive development perspective could be useful for creating targeted interventions tailored for young children. In the present study, we compare a previously reported computational thinking assessment with a battery of nine cognitive tests, which include fluid intelligence, working memory, planning, sequencing, mental rotation, vocabulary, and early math precursors such as numerical transcoding and symbolic magnitude comparison. Mixed-effects linear regressions were implemented with CT as a dependent variable to explore the associations between our variables. A subsample of children who participated in an educational robotics intervention were assessed in their robot programming performance, and its outcomes were compared with their CT assessments. Results suggest temporal sequencing ability and symbolic magnitude comparison are significant predictors of CT in kindergarten. Positive significant associations between robot programming and CT performance are reported.

AB  - The research aims to evaluate the effect of a robotics-based computational thinking program on executive functions and visuospatial skills in preschool children. Additionally, the study will explore the relationship between these three variables and early experiences with toys. The study will be a cluster-randomized controlled trial with pre- and post-intervention measures. Participants will be preschool children aged 5 to 6 years from both public and private institutions. The intervention will involve a new educational robotics device called ROVERSA and will consist of eight sessions distributed over four weeks, with the experimental group placed on a waitlist. To assess executive functions and visuospatial skills, standardized and validated neuropsychological measures will be used, including the Flanker task, the NIH Toolbox Card Sorting Test, the Corsi Block Test, the NEPSY-II Mental Rotation Test, the Pyramid of Mexico from the ENI-2 battery, and the Computational Thinking Test (CTt). Data analysis will begin with a hypothesis tested through ANOVA-MR, and linear regressions will be implemented to assess the relationship between variables. It is expected that the results will contribute to the discussion on teaching computational thinking and educational robotics as early learning experiences and their impact on the cognitive development of children.

AB  - Educators emphasize that computational thinking is especially helpful in raising problem-solving skills, improving logical reasoning, and developing analytical thinking. In this context, the aim of this study is to develop an online, interactive, valid, reliable and useful performance-based assessment tool for measuring computational thinking skills. Data were collected in two stages with three different measurement tools. In the data collection phase, a psychometric scale, a skill test and an interactive web application developed in this study were used. In the study in which a total of 203 high school students participated, it was determined that the students' computational thinking skills were at average level. as a result, a valid and reliable performance-based platform was developed for measuring computational thinking skills. It has also been concluded that the performance-based measurement tool makes a better measurement than the psychometric scale. It is emphasized that computational thinking should be treated as a skill or group of skills, not as a theoretical knowledge, product/portfolio or attitude/perception. Therefore, it is believed that developing performance-based tools for evaluating computational thinking skills and measuring them by using multiple measurement tools will give more accurate results. Considering the developments in computational thinking, it is thought that the study will contribute to the literature.

AB  - Computing education has progressively entered into children's early years. Due to a proliferation of computing education programs and coding tools designed for young children, research on the relationships between computational thinking (CT) and other domains of learning and development is highly warranted. Yet, there is little empirical evidence that shows the relationship between CT and children's overall cognitive functioning. As such, this study explored the relationships between Chinese children's CT and their sequencing ability and self-regulation in early childhood. One hundred and one Chinese young children (Ngirl = 52 and Nboy = 49; Mage = 5.25, SD = 0.73) were recruited and evaluated with three reliable instruments. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that: (1) CT positively predicted sequencing ability (β = 0.27, p < .05) even after controlling for relevant demographic covariates such as age, gender, and family socioeconomic status; (2) CT positively predicted self-regulation (β = 0.47, p < .001) after controlling for demographic covariates. Our findings suggest that CT may be a domain-general ability that is based on cognitive foundations that extend beyond the realm of computing.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is regarded as the conceptual basis required for identifying and solving real-world problems through algorithmic approaches to achieve transferable solutions. Developing students' CT in primary school stages is essential and has received considerable attention. Meanwhile, researchers incorporated digital badges into classrooms to improve students' learning motivation in computer science (CS). However, few solid empirical studies analyze the effects of the digital badges approach in CS education to develop students' CT. Therefore, to bridge this gap, this study designed and implemented a block-based programming course in a primary school and examined the impact of the digital badges approach on pupils' CT skills and self-efficacy and learning motivation in CS. A quasi-experimental design was conducted among 99 third-grade students across three classes. The results revealed that the adapted digital badges in primary school (1) significantly improved the students' CT skills, (2) had no significant positive impact on their CT self-efficacy or learning motivation in CS, and (3) showed no mediating effect of learning motivation on the relationship between CT skills and CT self-efficacy. In addition, we found that whether students could see only their own digital badges or also those of others had no impact on CT skills, self-efficacy, or learning motivation in CS. These findings have implications for the design of digital badge educational interventions intended to promote students' CT and learning motivation.

AB  - Computational thinking refers to a series of cognitive processes involved in solving problems through computational systems. A growing body of studies has managed to demonstrate the correlation between computational thinking and different cognitive domains. In recent decades, multiple studies have taken place that seek to evaluate the effect of computational thinking on higher-order cognitive processes. The current study aims to contribute to this discussion by analyzing the effect of an intervention program in computational thinking on the executive functions of school-age children. In this experimental study, 30 children aged 10 and 11 were randomly assigned to an experimental group and an active control group. The instruments to collect the data were 15 tests of the neuropsychological battery of executive functions and frontal lobes BANFE-2, which were applied to both groups before and after the intervention. The experimental group participated in an 8-week computational thinking intervention during which its participants enrolled in plugged and unplugged activities and carried out block programming language twice a week. The results showed that the intervention had significant effects on executive functions associated with the anterior prefrontal cortex and the dorsolateral cortex, but not those related to the orbitofrontal area.

AB  - Learning coding during early childhood is an effective way for children to practice computational thinking. Aspects of children's motivation can increase the likelihood that children approach computational thinking activities with enthusiasm and deep engagement. Gender inequities may interfere with children's readiness to take advantage of opportunities to build computational thinking skills through activities such as coding. Societal stereotypes can reduce young girls’ motivation to engage with computer science, preventing them from gaining benefits from coding activities designed to support computational thinking. This study examined children's gender stereotypes as well as children's own motivation for computer coding in 363 first- through third-grade children. We assessed gender differences in both stereotypes and motivation, as well as links between the stereotypes that individual children held and their own motivation. Children generally endorsed stereotypes about interest and ability for computer coding that favored their own-gender group, although third-grade girls reported gender-egalitarian beliefs about interest in coding. There were no gender differences in children's motivation for computer coding in terms of their own interest, sense of belonging, or ability self-concepts. Children's stereotypes about their own-gender group were significantly positively correlated with their own motivation for computer coding. These findings suggest that early childhood represents an excellent age for children to begin building computational thinking skills, before girls endorse negative stereotypes about their gender's interest in computer science.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is an essential skill students need if they are to adapt to the rise of digital society, and the evaluation of CT is crucial for enhancing students’ CT. However, the current evaluation of CT is based on a summative paradigm and ignores real CT performance during the assessment process. This study thus used a multimodal cognitive diagnostic model (H-MCDM) of students’ CT based on multimodal data in situational tasks, to achieve precise evaluation and explore the current mastery status of students’ CT and their cognitive and behavioral characteristics. The research results indicate that: 1) students’ CT was at a moderately high level and indicated a good grasp of the CT components of problem decomposition and algorithm design, but students had not yet mastered problem abstraction, 2) a total of six different CT latent patterns were discerned in the overall student results, 3) individual students who shared the same CT latent patterns could differ in their cognitive and behavioral characteristics, while those with different CT latent patterns could share similar characteristics. This study showed that it is possible to capture the degree of students’ mastery of CT and their cognitive and behavioral differences with the same or different CT latent patterns at a granular level, providing a basis for developing individualized strategies to enhance students’ CT.

AB  - In-service elementary school teachers need training to teach computational thinking (CT). A common model for CT professional learning programs includes an initial workshop followed by ongoing support. However, little research has examined the efficacy of ongoing support, the most effective types, and its impact on classroom practices. The current study details a multifaceted CT professional learning program with innovative ongoing support to help elementary school teachers implement the Code.org curriculum. It also empirically investigated the impact of the support on teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT, the effectiveness of each component of the support, and to what extent it affected teachers' classroom practices. Our ongoing support included an additional workshop, grade-level professional learning community (PLC) sessions, instructional videos, and teacher leaders' support. Data included a pre-survey, four post-surveys, lesson observations, a focus group interview, tracking the number of video views, and surveys from PLC participants and teacher leaders. Results indicated that the ongoing support significantly increased teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT. Regarding the effectiveness of the various components of the ongoing support, the additional workshop significantly increased teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT. Teachers valued each component of the support, and this support improved teachers’ classroom practices.

AB  - The present study investigates the debugging process of 526 children in preschool (4–6 aged) when programming a tangible robot. When a child is involved in programming, it is needed to identify and correct errors, or in other words, debug a program. Debugging is a high-level thinking skill and is an essential component closely related to developing Computational Thinking in early childhood education. Though the debugging process is a cognitive function in programming investigated by many researchers in recent decades, most studies are conducted either in primary, secondary education, or higher education concerning beginners or experts in programming. Very few reviews, and some focus on preschool education. Our study set out the following objectives: 1) How do children identify the existence of error and locate it? 2) What types of errors emerge when coding? 3) What type of error is complex for novice programmers? 4) What strategies are developed by novice programmers to debug effectively? and 5) What types of knowledge do novice programmers construct by debugging the tangible robot Bee-Bot? The study follows an iterative model of a design-based research approach. It uses multiple case studies to collect qualitative and quantitative data. The programming intervention was implemented by 30 educators in their classrooms and was based on a scenario-based teaching design. The debugging process was analysed using Klahr & Craven's framework (1988): 1) test and evaluate program, 2) identify bug, 3) represent program, 4) locate bug and 5) correct bug. The main finding is the construction and development of syntactic and semantic knowledge.

AB  - A plethora of programming platforms purports to teach preschool-aged children computational thinking (CT) and coding skills. However, the empirical evidence to support their effectiveness is still in its early stages. A three-week didactic intervention using ScratchJr was conducted to investigate its effectiveness in fostering CT and rudimentary coding skills in a cohort of preschool children (N = 34, aged 4–6 years). While the initial performance mean of the control group (M = 7.07, SD = 2.58) exhibits a statistically significant elevation t (22.64 = 2.23, p = 0.036) vis-à-vis the experimental group (M = 5.35, SD = 1.58), t (22.64) = 2.23, p = 0.0 the terminal performance means of both groups converge closely. However, meticulous data analysis unveils a statistically notable enhancement among preschool participants exposed to the educational intervention involving ScratchJr. Notably, both instructional modalities appear commensurate in nurturing elementary computational tenets, namely modularity and control structures. The experimental cohort outperforms the control group with statistical significance in comprehending potent ideational constructs encompassing representation, algorithms, and hardware/software interplay. Conversely, the control group performs better in grasping the debugging concept than their experimental counterparts. The outcomes lend substantive credence to the efficacy of the distinct programming milieu offered by ScratchJr, underscoring its effectiveness in cultivating CT and coding proficiencies within the preschool demographic.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is crucial for students. Robot-supported learning has emerged as a popular approach for CT cultivation. To understand the effects of robot-supported CT cultivation, the current study conducted a meta-analysis to analyze studies from Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Science Direct databases (2012–2022) which screened using keywords ``computational thinking'' and ``robot''. After further screening, 26 peer-reviewed articles were selected. We synthesized the 33 effect sizes to assess the overall effectiveness of robot-supported learning on CT and its sub-dimensions: concepts, practices, and perspectives. Our findings revealed a medium effect of robot-supported learning on students' CT (g = 0.643), a large effect on CT concepts (g = 0.650), a medium effect on CT practices (g = 0.587), and a huge effect on CT perspectives (g = 1.419). We also explored the moderators (i.e., grade level, study duration, culture, learning strategy, and assessment tool) that might influence the effects of robot-supported CT cultivation. Moderator analyses indicated that short-term (less than four weeks) robot-supported learning had a larger effect (g = 0.901) on CT practice than long-term (more than eleven weeks) learning (g = 0.309). This meta-analysis indicates that educators could apply robot-supported learning to cultivate students' CT and concludes with related implications.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has gained increasing recognition as a 21st-century competency. Although initiatives have been taken to define the term for educational practices, limited empirical evidence is available to clarify its underlying components, especially at the primary education level. This study aimed to identify the associations between CT and specific cognitive skills in the primary school context. Based on the literature, three cognitive domains were studied (i.e., mathematical, visuospatial, and reasoning skills) and standard test batteries were applied to a sample of 633 primary students (aged 7–12 years). Linear regression analyses were performed with CT performance as the dependent variable to investigate its associations with the measured cognitive skills, and demographic features (i.e., age, gender) and coding learning experience (i.e., years of coding experience, extra-curricular coding experience) were included as control variables. The results indicated that the students’ CT performance was significantly predicted by their attainments in numeracy, visual perception, spatial visualisation, and inductive reasoning, and the results remained significant after controlling for demographics and coding experience. The study adds to the literature by enriching the understanding of CT as a psychological construct and has practical implications for educational stakeholders regarding the importance of interdisciplinary teaching and the integration of specific cognitive skills into CT learning activities.

AB  - The sustainable and digital future of work may imply a dramatic equilibrium change between social factors and technological ones. We argue that providing suitable tools to support End-User Development (EUD) in the workplace could represent a way to cope with such future changes. The contributions of this paper include the analysis and characterization of the most used EUD techniques and their crossover with a new conveyed model of Computational Thinking. The synthesis between these aspects is made explicit in the construct of EUDability, which is designed to capture the quality dimensions of EUD systems suitable to work scenarios where better roles and better tools for individuals may be shaped. EUDability has to do with identifying and assessing the difficulties of EUD techniques on one side and the Computational Thinking skills held by individuals on the other side.

AB  - There has been an increasing interest in the integration of technology into language education. Meanwhile, computational thinking (CT) skills are fostered which influence communicative language teaching and learning. Despite CT's established importance in science education, its significance in language teaching remains scarce. This study contributes to knowledge synthesis and methodological development by reviewing 16 journal articles, analyzing CT applications in language learning across educational contexts, intervention tools, CT skills, language acquisition, and assessment methods. The results indicate that (a) more CT-involved activities are needed for primary, secondary, and tertiary education, (b) educational robots and Scratch stand out as the most trending intervention tools, (c) CT skills such as decomposition, abstraction, generalization and so on have a positive effect on students’ foreign language acquisition, especially in grammar and writing, (d) assessment of CT development can be surveyed through a validated and reliable instrument such as computer programming self-efficacy scale or an online platform: Dr. Scratch; Conversely, there is a diversity of evaluation tools in foreign language learning. This study is the first to review experimental research on integrating computational thinking into foreign language learning and offers significant implications for future research.

AB  - The development of programming skills and computational thinking in the formal educational context is one of the most recent horizons set by many educational systems worldwide. Although the first computational thinking initiatives are being applied from the earliest school ages, this research focuses on the secondary education level. Specifically, the objective is the following: to analyse the implementation of Arduino, as well as the benefits and opportunities it brings to secondary school students. For this purpose, documentary research has been undertaken applying a systematic review according to the PRISMA 2020 framework following the PiCoS strategy. Atlas.ti 9 was used to analyse the information. Out of 316 papers identified, 37 were included in the research. In relation to the results, Arduino is primarily used in technology and physics subjects, although it is also used to develop interdisciplinary STEAM projects. As a rule, it is used to learn programming languages, but likewise as a resource to develop science experiments. LED lights, servomotors and breadboards are among the most commonly used resources together with the Arduino board. and Scratch was the most widely used software. The initiatives implemented have yielded both positive and negative results, for example, one drawback is that some projects are very difficult, and some achievements such as: increased motivation towards the contents addressed or also the development of some soft skills, such as problem solving.

AB  - Recently, virtual reality (VR) technology has shown great potential in advancing education with many pedagogical benefits for building the 21st-century teaching and learning experience. This study conducted a formative evaluation of an immersive VR expedition application with the aim of understanding users' learning processes and how the application facilitates higher education students' computational thinking skills. Six participants were randomly selected to conduct this evaluation. A mixed research approach consisting of quantitative and qualitative methods was employed. The study quantitatively analyzed users' scores from gameplay to understand how the intervention supported computational thinking skills. Participants were also interviewed to collect data after playing the mini-games to investigate users' experiences. The study showcases players' computational thinking competency, assessed automatically during gameplay. Further, this study used inductive content analysis to demonstrate users' reactions to prototyped VR mini-games. The qualitative findings suggest that users found the VR mini-games interactive and immersive, which provided an opportunity to foster learners' computational thinking skills. The quantitative analysis revealed that student's computational thinking competency can be enhanced through consistent playing of the mini-games. Moreover, the expedition aspect of the VR game stimulated learners' curiosity, which sustained their learning progress. Furthermore, users gained new knowledge and found the mini-games educative. Nevertheless, several aspects of the VR mini-games need improvements, according to users' perceptions. This study contributes to the knowledge in terms of the affordances of VR in education research and provides relevant insights that can shape future studies, for example, the recent hype of metaverse in education.

AB  - Project-Based Learning (PBL) and Computational Thinking (CT), a teaching strategy and a problem-solving method, respectively, have been widely used in teaching and learning because of their educational advantages for students and teachers. However, studies of their integration into the teaching and learning process have been scarce, resulting in a lack of guidance for educators to implement such an approach that apply constructivism learning theory. This study aims to systematically review and identify appropriate frameworks, models, techniques and tools that could guide the successful implementation of PBL-CT. This study examined relevant articles published from 2017 to 2021 to highlight the gaps in the PBL-CT execution and map their backgrounds into a coherent taxonomy that could help guide the directions of future studies. As revealed, none of such articles explicitly explain any suitable PBL-CT frameworks or models. The study identified several common elements for the PBL-CT framework formulation, indicating scaffolding and inquiry are the most commonly applied techniques, with visual tools dominating the PBL-CT implementation. Most articles involved computing, followed by STEM, with a few originating from non-STEM fields. Several important implications could help educators develop an effective PBL-CT course design and provide some guidelines for future research. An effective PBL-CT integration enhances teaching and learning besides improving students' computational thinking skills. Thinking skills are critical 21st-century skills needed for students' success.

AB  - Computational thinking has become an integral component of curricula worldwide, necessitating teachers to develop this competence in their students. To effectively meet these curricular requirements, teachers themselves need a solid foundation of computational thinking content knowledge, which refers to the understanding and skills they possess in this area. However, despite widespread recognition of this need, few studies have rigorously examined teachers' content knowledge in this domain. Addressing this gap requires the development of high-quality measurement tools. This study details the development of an instrument, created as part of the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) 2023 in Flanders, to measure lower secondary school teachers' computational thinking content knowledge in a valid and reliable way. The article first outlines the construction process of the instrument, which involved close collaboration with experts in the field and drew upon the framework of Fraillon et al. (2023). Following this, the instrument's psychometric properties are presented, which include both item-level and overall instrument characteristics. These properties were evaluated using data from a sample of 352 participants, applying both Classical Test Theory and Item Response Theory. The final tool consists of sixteen multiple-choice and short constructed response questions. The results indicate favorable item and overall instrument characteristics, thereby affirming its potential to measure the intended construct in a valid and accurate way.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) skills help students both understand and utilize computing in various domains to cope with the challenges posed by the complex digital world. This study applied mind mapping to programming language instruction in a primary school, and explored the effects of mind mapping on students' CT skills when learning programming with Scratch as a programming tool. Two types of mind mapping, construct-by-self mind mapping (CBS-MM) and construct-on-scaffold mind mapping (COS-MM), were proposed to compare which type is more effective in terms of students' CT skills. Seventy-three public primary school fifth-grade students aged 10 to 11 participated in the study. The CBS group included 33 students learning with the CBS-MM instructional approach, while the COS group comprised 40 students learning with the COS-MM instructional approach. Data were obtained from nine topic Scratch programming assignments and pre- and post-CT skills surveys completed by the two groups. Paired sample t tests were used to analyze whether the two types of mind mapping approach could improve both groups' CT skills. One-way ANCOVA and one-way ANOVA were used to examine the difference in the two groups' CT skills. The results showed that both CBS-MM and COS-MM can improve students' CT skills; however, the COS group students could better improve their CT skills with the assistance of the COS-MM method compared with the CBS group students who learned with the CBS-MM method. The findings of this study can provide some enlightenment for relevant instructors to design instruction and implement programming teaching with different kinds of mind mapping support that facilitates students’ CT.

AB  - The specific mechanisms by which teachers and parents can provide culturally relevant opportunities for computational thinking for racially/ethnically and linguistically diverse groups of preschoolers remain unknown. Accordingly, the purpose of this research is to examine how PreK parent and teacher voice directed efforts to realize a culturally relevant computing program. We drew data sources from a subsample of design-based research meetings in which partners collaborated to co-develop the first iteration of the program. Using qualitative analysis, we examined how parent voice and teacher voice, conceptualized as perspectives and participation, influenced theories of culturally responsive computing and computational thinking in early childhood education and the translation of theory into practice in classroom and home settings. Findings showed that connecting powerful ideas from computational thinking, namely algorithms and problem solving (e.g., debugging), to familiar activities and experiences served as a powerful entry point. Yet, differences arose in how teachers and parents conceptualized culturally relevant computing and made connections to familiar routines. We discuss what can be learned from parent voice in regards to bolstering children's self-expression, access to increasingly complex computational thinking tasks, and opportunities for learning cultural and community values through computing.

AB  - In recent years, the development of computational thinking (CT) has become integral to many school curricula worldwide. This has been associated with calls for computational thinking to be considered a ‘21St Century’ competency, valuable to all students as a transferable process for solving problems and building understanding of human behaviour and systems. However, while computational thinking is a focus of most secondary school computer science curricula, proponents such as Jeanette Wing argue its relevance for younger students, indicating more work must be done investigating its development in early years' education. This study used a structured, problem-based curriculum supported by guided inquiry pedagogy, to explore 6 year old students' learning of basic computational thinking concepts and practices while coding programmable floor robots (Blue-bots and an iPad app). Results indicated improvement across the seven lessons in students' sequencing/algorithm authoring, error correction, and pattern recognition. Furthermore, they revealed evidence of higher order thinking such as identifying patterns in code, and how these can be transferred to help solve problems of different designs. While currently play-based approaches are used to introduce computational thinking concepts and practices in early years' education, results from this study suggest that more structured, problem-based methods should be seriously considered. Results challenge commonly understood developmental theories about what young children can and can't do, contextualised within the field of computer science, and hold implications for early years' teachers' professional knowledge and pedagogy if they are to promote their students' learning in this increasingly important area. Given rapid technological advancements such as artificial intelligence (AI) and increasingly earlier exposure of young children to digitally-mediated information, this study provides support for the earlier and more systematic introduction of basic digital literacy knowledge and skills in early years' education.

AB  - We conducted a systematic review of empirical studies aimed at exploring robot-mediated activities to promote the development of computational thinking in preschoolers. In this study, we investigated the robots used, proposed activities, and evaluation processes. We also analyzed research contexts and the stated motivations to conduct the studies. Our review identified characteristics of the robots, such as input and output interfaces, cost, and availability. We also categorized activities considering context, modality of work, type of activities, duration, adults’ role, scaffolding, unplugged activities, explicit debugging, communication and sharing instances, and teaching knowledge from other domains. We analyzed the computational thinking evaluation process looking at types of assessments, asset concepts, and research design. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of existing research, identifies existing gaps, and provides recommendations for future studies.

AB  - The integration of computational thinking (CT) into K-12 education offers substantial potential to improve digital literacy and deepen students’ understanding across various subject areas. By embedding computational procedures and solution-oriented approaches into traditional curricula, students can develop essential skills that are critical for thriving in an increasingly digital world. However, the effective integration of CT into subject-specific learning poses challenges for educators, largely due to a lack of training and experience in implementing interdisciplinary instructional strategies. This study explores the impact of integrating CT into K-12 education through diverse instructional approaches, including modelling, storytelling, and unplugged activities. The research examines how students' subject knowledge, CT concepts, and practices evolved under each CT integration practice, as well as their acceptance toward CT integrated lessons. The study was conducted in different subjects, including language arts, biology, and physics, and at different grade levels. The technology acceptance model was used as a theoretical framework to understand students' adoption towards the different integration practices. The study revealed that different CT integration practices yield varying impacts on students' attitudes, particularly in relation to their prior programming experiences. Namely, primary school students with prior programming experience display a higher behavioural intention due to a lack of early biases toward programming. Conversely, secondary school students, less familiar with interdisciplinary approaches, initially show less enthusiasm for future engagement. These insights underscore the need for tailored instructional strategies that consider students' prior experiences and the broader goal of preparing them to contribute to a technologically driven society.

AB  - As we begin to identify essential skills for the future, there has been an increased focus on how to define and implement computational thinking within education. However, the question of how to engage children with coding activities within the context and limitations of the curriculum remains relatively explored. In our study, a human-centered design approach was followed to guide a small group of children through the co-design, implementation and evaluation of a board game. The board game had two versions: an offline version involving a robotic agent and an online version with its digital equivalent. A mixed-method approach was used to understand and compare levels of engagement, usability, and collaboration in both versions of the game. The tangible aspect of working with a robotic agent in the offline version led to greater levels of motivation and involvement with the game mechanics. Tangible robotics games tend to be more approachable for children. Our study shows that using such games by connecting the mathematics curriculum with coding problems can successfully engage participants in collaborative computational thinking activities. We contribute to the field by providing human-centered guidance for the creation of educational tools to develop computational thinking. Such guidance is not only applicable in technologically rich environments; it can also be applied in educational communities with limited access to technology.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has been relevant in teaching STEM courses, and educators are incorporating both plugged and unplugged CT activities in their modules to prepare new entrants for advanced knowledge. However, additional empirical data are needed to understand how an unplugged activities approach can lead to an improved understanding of CT concepts. Therefore, this study investigates the impact of unplugged activities on novice students' CT skills and unravels the characteristics of students' CT competency from performing unplugged activities. The experimental aspect of this study was conducted with a cohort of 210 students participating in an introductory programming course at a University in Nigeria. A mixed-method research approach and a quasi-experimental design were applied in this study to understand how the unplugged approach in teaching CT could help students improve their CT competency. A paired-sample t-test of familiarity score for each CT concept showed a significant increase in the score before and after the intervention. Furthermore, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was used for topic modeling of the text describing students’ solutions. Topic modeling allows for more insights into the steps taken by the students to solve CT problems. Only 27.62 % of students' solution descriptions contained CT concepts, 56.90 % of the students solved the puzzle with an optimal score, and 72.41 % of students who applied CT concepts of problem abstraction and decomposition were able to solve the puzzle correctly. Indeed, CT unplugged activities significantly increased the number of students who gained CT competency. In addition, this study provides recommendation for computer science educators and highlight future direction.

AB  - Computational thinking is a fundamental competence that is being introduced in K-12 and succeeding curricula worldwide. Despite this huge effort, many computational thinking models in the literature do not explicitly take into consideration the pupils’ age and the developmental nature of computational thinking skills. Furthermore, many existing computational thinking models are focused on the internal thinking processes of the individuals, failing to explicitly consider the situated nature, in terms of social context and artefactual environment, that usually characterise tasks that require computational thinking to be solved. In this paper, we present a framework for the design, realisation, analysis, and assessment of computational thinking activities, called CT-cube. The CT-cube allows to extend existing computational thinking models to consider the life-long development of computational thinking skills in individuals, from childhood to adult age, and to take into consideration the situated nature of computational thinking activities. We use the CT-cube to design an unplugged task, called Cross Array Task (CAT), allowing to assess the algorithmic skills of K-12 pupils and we show how the CT-cube can be used in this case to illustrate the development of this competence along the entire compulsory school path, considering a sample of 109 pupil aged 3 to 16 in Switzerland.

AB  - The current single teaching and assessing modes of English as a foreign language (EFL) grammar in China have caused the disconnect between grammar knowledge and competency with numerous errors in essay writing, somehow ignoring the analysis of learners thinking patterns. To solve the problem, computational thinking (CT), a higher-order thinking in solving problems and optimizing the way to acquire knowledge, was employed in the study. As needed, the experimental group was taught using the CT teaching model following CT principal elements (data analysis, pattern recognition, abstraction, decomposition, and parallelization), while the control group followed the traditional teaching mode. Quantitative and qualitative data were obtained based on the pre-test-post-test, classroom observation, and questionnaire survey. The results show that the grammar application in short essay writing of all the members of the experimental group significantly improved and that higher grammar learning agency and engagement were unfolded to show the changes of thinking patterns. However, not all the members from the control group showed similar results. CT serves as an important social mediation tool in EFL teaching. This study further enriches the teaching modes of grammar and is an effective attempt at introducing CT into learners’ thinking patterns.

AB  - With growing interest in supporting the development of computational thinking (CT) in early childhood, there is also need for new assessments that serve multiple purposes and uses. In particular, there is a need to understand the design of formative assessments that can be used during classroom instruction to provide feedback to teachers and children in real-time. In this paper, we report on an empirical study and advance a new unit of observational analysis for formative assessment that we call an indicator of a knowledge refinement opportunity or as a shorthand, KRO indicators. We put forth a new framework for conceptualizing the design of formative assessments that builds on the Evidence Centered Design framework but centers identification and analysis of indicators of knowledge refinement opportunities. We illustrate a number of key indicators through empirical examples drawn from video recordings of Kindergarten classroom lessons.

AB  - Interest in coding education has exploded in the past five years, especially in elementary and early secondary education. Teachers who are largely new to coding are expected to guide entire student bodies through the fundamentals of coding and computational thinking. But little is known about which coding and computational thinking (CT) concepts teachers feel most comfortable with and which concepts they struggle with. This study describes 127 elementary coding teachers’ changes in their beliefs about teaching coding and CT as they participated in year-long continuous professional development. Novice elementary coding teachers demonstrated most growth in their self-efficacy for teaching sequences, algorithms and loops. They were less secure in their knowledge of conditionals, variables, and functions. For computational thinking, teachers were most confident in their ability to identify patterns, think algorithmically, understand logic, and evaluate outcomes, showing less growth with decomposition and abstraction.

AB  - This study compares the effects of coding education with educational robot and unplugged coding activities on pre-school students' computational thinking and executive function skills. This study used a pre-test and post-test comparison group quasi-experimental design. The study was conducted in a public kindergarten with 48 pre-school students (24 educational robot- BeeBot® group and 24-unplugged coding group) aged 5-6. The TechCheck-K test was used to measure computational thinking skills, and Executive Functions Battery-Computerized Touch was used to measure executive function skills. The process started with pre-test applications and ended with post-tests after four weeks (16 different sessions) of the implementation in both groups. The study found a statistically significant difference between the computational thinking pre-test and post-test scores of pre-school students in both groups in favor of the post-test. It was determined that there was a statistically significant difference in favor of the educational robot group between the post-test scores of computational thinking skills. In addition, when the findings regarding executive functions were evaluated, there was a statistically significant difference between the pre-test and post-test scores of total executive function in favor of the post-test in both groups. However, it was observed that there was no statistically significant difference between the post-test scores of both groups in terms of total executive function skills scores. In addition, when the post-test scores of pre-school students in two groups were evaluated, it was determined that there was no significant difference in computational thinking and executive function skills according to gender. Consequently, it was determined that coding education with an educational robot was more effective for gaining computational thinking skills than unplugged coding activities for pre-school students. However, it was observed that there was no difference between the two groups in terms of the development of executive function skills in pre-school education.

AB  - Since environmental and energy issues and challenges continues to emerge as key global concerns, Green Building Certification Systems are becoming increasingly relevant in the construction industry. In this regard, LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is considered one of the most widely recognized environmental assessment methods used globally in the construction industry today. However, due to the high level of complexity of the LEED system, the tools usually used to verify the achievement of the credits lack of “design friendliness” and hardly communicate effectively with the conventional tools used by architects and engineers (e.g. CAD, BIM). This makes difficult to fully take into account, especially at the early design stage, the many interconnected aspects that contribute to the green certification, with consequent issues often arising in the design validation and/or construction phases, resulting in time delays and cost increments. The application of innovative problem-solving methods, such as computational thinking, together with coding techniques, represents an effective way to deal with this issue. This kind of methodology, in fact, allows the requirements of a specific LEED credit to be digitally parametrised and flexibly incorporated into a “designer friendly” working environment. In particular, Visual Programming Languages (VPLs), due to their high simplicity of usage, allow architects and engineers to develop algorithms and thus implement their technical knowledge in the field of environmental design with computer programming skills, useful to improve their tools and keep them constantly updated. The aim of this paper is to illustrate a methodology through which, by merging computational thinking strategies with VPL tools, is possible to keep under control, in the same working environment, all the parameters required to verify in real time the achievement of LEED credits. To demonstrate the flexibility of the approach, dedicated tools developed for the verification of some specific credits at different scales – neighbourhood and building – are illustrated as operational examples of the proposed methodology.

AB  - Computational thinking, defined by Wing (2011) as the “thought processes involved in formulating problems … so that the solutions are represented in a form that can effectively be carried out by an information-processing agent,” has become the central construct of K12 computing education around the world. This article provides a history of computational thinking, a summary of computational thinking's role in educational policy and practice, role as a research construct, and concludes by considering the future of computational thinking. The debate over how to define and teach computational thinking can be understood as a proxy for the broader questions about education.

AB  - Collecting and organizing data to understand and answer real-world questions is an increasingly important skill in our current world. Fostering data collection and analysis (DCA) skills in young children leverages key mathematics skills as well as the data representation, visualization, and interpretation skills of computational thinking (CT), culminating in a problem-solving approach with data. As such, the intervention, comprising investigations and a digital app, supported preschool teachers and children to answer data-focused questions by engaging in each step of the DCA process in order to foster CT and math skills. Teachers appreciated that the app offers a new way for children to visualize data and noted that the app provided learning opportunities for children that would not otherwise be possible or easy to implement.

AB  - Computational Thinking (CT), the conceptual foundations required for solving complex problems effectively and efficiently, is an imperative skill for today's learners, across disciplines and across ages. As for its importance in the wide network of digital literacies, CT has been implemented in various educational contexts, however mostly via digital artifacts, specifically in programming-related activities. This approach does not fulfill the potential of such integration for promoting learning. In this paper, we argue that digital literacies should not be bound to the digital realm, and present a novel approach to fully integrate CT into learning and teaching by the development of CT-infused “unplugged” pedagogical tools that are fully embedded in the subject matter. We demonstrate the advantages to student learning of these tools in two case studies from K-12 mathematics education: 1) An assistive tool for function investigation in high-school calculus – in this case, we point out to how CT skills that were implemented in the tool promoted students' problem solving; 2) A teaching unit for pattern sequences in elementary school – in this case, we show how students in the CT research group outperformed students in the other groups, and how they implemented CT to solve pattern sequence problems effectively and efficiently. We highlight that besides enhancing learning, this approach can help address the important issue of equity in education, and suggest ways to promote it via dedicated professional development.

AB  - Creativity and Computational Thinking (CT) have been pointed out as two important skills that would promote students in the digital age as contributing members of society. Therefore, these two constructs have been extensively researched in recent years, but the associations between them are yet to be fully understood. This study takes another step towards bridging this gap by examining the association between CT and three types of creativity, i.e., Figural Creative Thinking, Verbal Creative Thinking, and Computational Creativity. Data was collected from 119 ninth-grade students (14–15 years old) from Israel. Students took two commonly used creativity tests (Torrance's Test of Creative Thinking, and the Alternative Uses Test). They also used Kodetu—an online learning environment for CT—and we used the system log files to measure their CT acquirement and their computational creativity. Findings suggest some nuanced associations between the four sets of variables. Specifically, we point out the limited associations between verbal and figural creativities, some of which are negative; also, we found that the associations between creative thinking and CT, as well as between creative thinking and computational creativity, differ by gender.

AB  - Many studies have demonstrated that Virtual Exchange (VE) for teaching languages can have a positive effect on learners' intercultural awareness or achievements. However, during this century, the teaching process has shifted from teaching with technology to solving problems with it. In this regard, pedagogical experts in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) have developed programming and robotics based on Computational Thinking skills (CTs), which have been regarded as the core of 21st-century skills. In the field of CALL, this skill has received very little attention. Accordingly, we have attempted to switch the process and outcome of language learning in VE. Thus, we developed the conceptual framework that integrated CTsCALL and Individual-technology-task-environment Fit (ITTEF). Having designed our VE tasks based on CTsCALL, we provided the opportunity for 92 Spanish language learners in our project to exchange language and culture with Cypriot and Irish students and solve VE tasks based on CTsCALL. The result of the symmetric phase of the study validated the five-dimensional structure of CTsCALL and the four-dimensional structures of ITTEF in VE and CALL. It also revealed that language learners, who focused on the key information rather than the details while solving language tasks, as well as recognizing the pattern of task solving and applying them to other tasks, found VE, and CTsCALL to be aligned with their current capabilities, learning environment, and problem-solving skills that mediated their intention to learn and exchange information in this context in the future. Furthermore, the asymmetrical part of the study revealed that sixteen solutions are available to shape language learners' continued intention to use VE by combining the components of CTsCALL and ITTEF. Thus, the study developed the CTsCALL questionnaire and its theory into CALL together with the Council of Europe's Common European Framework of Reference for Languages and recommended that CALL researchers and educators take a broader view of VE, as well as continuing to validate CTsCALL in other CALL disciplines to show that this skill belongs to CALL as well.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is gaining increasing attention from researchers and practitioners all over the world to empower children in the digital era. However, there is no consensus on which components of CT to teach beginning coders in early childhood education (ECE). To address this issue, we conducted a systematic review of 42 empirical studies focused on teaching and assessing CT in ECE. We analyzed the included studies with the three-dimensional CT framework proposed by Brennan and Resnick (2012) and demonstrated how this framework could be modified to fit the context of ECE. Based on this systematic review, we sorted out the CT components that were proven suitable for young children to learn by incorporating emerging components and removing components inappropriate for young children. We thus proposed a CT curriculum framework for ECE that covers CT concepts (i.e., control flow/structures, representation, and hardware/software), CT practices (i.e., algorithmic design, pattern recognition, abstraction, debugging, decomposition, iteration, and generalizing), and CT perspectives (i.e., expressing and creating, connecting, perseverance, and choices of conduct). This systematic review and its associated CT curriculum framework provide important theoretical contributions and practical implications for early childhood CT education.

AB  - In this paper, we review and meta-analyze the findings of experimental studies published between 2006 and 2022 that examined the effects of coding and programming interventions on children's core and higher order executive functions (response inhibition, working memory, cognitive flexibility, planning and problem solving). The systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to address three research questions: 1) Which executive functions are most impacted by the teaching of CT? 2) Which instructional modality (educational robotics/virtual coding/unplugged coding) is most effective in enhancing executive function skills in learners aged 4–16 years? and 3) Does the cognitive effectiveness of coding vary with children's age? A total of 19 studies with 1523 participants met the selection criteria for the systematic review. The meta-analysis included 11 of those studies. The results reveal beneficial effects of structured virtual and tangible coding (educational robotics) activities for preschoolers and first graders, and significant effects of more unstructured virtual coding activities (e.g., Scratch-based) for older students. A multivariate fixed-effects model meta-analysis shows that the teaching of coding significantly improves problem-solving with the highest effect (dppc2 = 0.89), but also planning (dppc2 = 0.36), and inhibition and working memory with lower effects (dppc2 = 0.17, dppc2 = 0.20).

AB  - In light of the increasing importance digital economy, the significance of computational thinking has grown exponentially, becoming imperative in both workplace and academic settings such as universities. This article addresses the critical need to comprehend the factors influencing the acceptance of computational thinking. The dataset introduces an extensive questionnaire comprising five constructs and 25 items, rooted in the extended Technology Acceptance Model. Notably, the model incorporates facilitating conditions and subjective norm, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding acceptance. Data collection involved 132 undergraduate university students sampled through purposive sampling, specifically targeting courses with a focus on computational thinking. The resulting dataset serves as a valuable resource for future research, offering detailed insights into the factors determining the acceptance of technology in educational contexts beyond mere thinking skills. Given the scarcity of research on technology acceptance in developing nations, this dataset holds particular significance, serving as a foundation for potential cross-cultural comparisons. The dataset contributes to the field by presenting a robust acceptance model, explaining 74.2 per cent of the variance in behavioural intention, 60.2 per cent in perceived usefulness, and 56.1 per cent in perceived ease of use. This high explanatory power positions the dataset as a superior resource for replication, benchmarking, and broader applicability in diverse contexts, thereby enhancing the understanding of computational thinking acceptance across different populations and settings. This dataset stands among the pioneering efforts to assess the novel covariance-based structural equation model algorithm within SmartPLS 4, presenting a valuable resource for future research employing the same mechanism.

AB  - This paper describes a study designed to investigate the promise of resources that support the development of computational thinking (CT) in preschool children. This study was the culmination of a collaborative research process between researchers and media developers of a home-based intervention that included media and hands-on activities created to support the development of young children's CT. The mixed-methods study included 108 families, each with a 4- or 5-year-old child. Families, who participated in the study at home for six weeks, were randomly assigned to an intervention group that viewed media and engaged with hands-on activities with a CT focus or a control group that viewed and engaged with non-STEM literacy content. Data collection consisted of parent surveys, parent interviews, and CT learning and pre-coding tasks to assess children's CT abilities. Results indicate that the learning intervention demonstrates promise in supporting parental understanding of CT. Experience with the intervention over the six weeks also appeared to cultivate some CT strategy use in children as evidenced by parental reports and performance on learning and pre-coding sequencing tasks.

AB  - This study characterizes the literature on teaching computational thinking (CT) to preschoolers aged 4 to 5 years. Previous research and published systematic studies have provided important contributions about CT teaching to elementary and high school children. However, to date, there is no systematic overview of CT education for preschoolers. For this reason, this systematic mapping synthesizes 82 studies on CT teaching, through the implementation and evaluation of tools and activities to teach, improve or measure the CT knowledge acquired by children. Furthermore, studies on courses or training offered to preschool teachers related to the teaching of CT were also considered. From the selected studies, the following information was collected: year of publication; recovery sources and databases; vehicles and places of publication; temporal delimitation of research, research approach, nature and research method; CT teaching approaches; tools used to teach CT and how they are classified according to their physical characteristics and, finally, participants and individuals responsible for the research. The results suggest an increase in the number of publications in recent years, revealing the interest of researchers in the topic. Furthermore, we observed a trend towards the use of physical artifacts and the use of the disconnected computing approach to teaching CT skills to preschool children. The results also exposed that preschool teachers have little autonomy in implementing CT teaching activities because those are mostly implemented by computer professionals (researchers, teachers, etc.). This is because preschool teachers are still discouraged from teaching computer and technology-related content to children, considering them complex and disconnected from basic curricula. However, when teachers are trained to teach CT, they become interested in the content and become more active during the teaching process. We argue for integrating CT-related content into education curricula and supporting preschool teachers to implement it autonomously in their classrooms.

AB  - This paper deals within a context where technology plays a pivotal role in education. In this sense, it is essential to highlight the emergence of new competencies and skills in education due to technological advancements. Legislative frameworks have been developed to incorporate digital literacy, access to robotics, and computational thinking, between others. Hence, this review and meta-analysis aim at identifying the influence of robotics activities on computational thinking through a PRISMA-guided review. The findings reveal that interventions conducted in early childhood education significantly impact computational thinking. Results also showcase that, despite perceived barriers related to technology accessibility, the presence of legislation and contexts prioritizing these competencies is more relevant than the digital access gap.

AB  - Since computational thinking is a high-level cognitive skill and its conceptual framework has not yet been clarified, the assessment of this skill is problematic. While there is no consensus in the literature about the components of computational thinking, the abstraction component is located at a point where opinions intersect. In addition, it is predicted that computer science unplugged activities will improve computational thinking, and there is limited research examining this effect. As a result, this research aims to demonstrate the alleged effects of computer science unplugged activities on abstraction skill which is considered the critical component of computational thinking. The study, which was planned with a mixed methods research design, lasted 8 weeks. Quantitative data were obtained from the abstraction skill test developed by the researchers, while qualitative data were obtained from observations and task- based interviews after each activity. Quantitative findings showed that computer science unplugged activities significantly improve abstraction skills and thus computational thinking. Qualitative findings not only revealed that developments in the six abstracting steps caused this significant difference but also identified abstracting steps where the effect of each activity was limited. Suggestions for organizing activities to improve these steps are given. Finally, suggestions are presented for the conceptual framework of computational thinking based on abstraction.

AB  - The healthy development of cognitive functions, including executive functions, has been shown to depend mainly on the experiences and learning opportunities of people, especially during childhood. Over the past few years, researchers have been studying the impacts of diverse types of interventions on children’s cognitive development in which computational thinking programs are a recent field. This pilot study evaluated the effect of computational thinking training based on the “Programming for Children” program on the executive functions of children aged 10 and 11 years: working memory, inhibition, and planning (N = 30). The results showed that children in the experimental group improved on tests of visuospatial working memory, cognitive inhibition, and sequential planning compared with the control group. However, tests of verbal working memory, memory strategy, and visual spatial planning did not show any observed changes. Although this was an exploratory study, and its findings should be interpreted cautiously due to the small sample size, the findings support the relevance and feasibility of conducting similar larger studies with larger samples.

AB  - Computational thinking has been promoted as an impactful 21st-century skillset that can be transferred to many other disciplines and problem scenarios. With the proliferation of age-appropriate coding platforms for young children, computational thinking has become increasingly popular in early childhood settings. However, there is a lack of research on introducing coding and computational thinking to teacher training in early childhood education. To empower early childhood teachers in the digital society, this study introduced 17 early childhood teachers to robot programming and computational thinking through the ‘CT4ECE’ professional development program, which includes three phases: Learn, Practice, and Reflect & Improve. Results of pre- and post-intervention surveys revealed that the CT4ECE program significantly enhanced teachers' robotics and pedagogical knowledge, as well as their attitudes towards computational thinking, especially their interest in and their view of using computational thinking in classroom practice. Post-intervention interviews indicated that participation in CT4ECE helped educators gain a basic understanding of both coding robots and computational thinking suitable for young children due to a structured change process for teachers' professional learning. This study establishes a strong foundation for enhancing and expanding the CT4ECE program, ultimately equipping teachers and children with the necessary skillsets to thrive in the digital future.

AB  - The purpose of the current study is to investigate the effects of the unplugged computational thinking (CT) integrated STEM (UCT-STEM) approach and STEM approach on early childhood pre-service teachers’ CT skills (creativity, algorithmic thinking, critical thinking, problem solving, cooperativity, communication). The study was conducted with a total of 70 early childhood pre-service teachers. Quasi-experimental design was used; activities based on the UCT-STEM approach were administered to the experimental group and activities based on the STEM approach were administered to the control group. Post-test scores for CT skills showed a statistically significant difference in favour of the experimental group. It was concluded that the UCT-STEM approach was more effective in developing the pre-service teachers’ CT skills than the STEM approach. The current study presents an important finding to the literature in terms of the developed STEM and UCT-STEM contents and how these contents improve pre-service teachers’ CT skills. The STEM and UCT-STEM content provides significant information in terms of teacher practices. At the same time, this study offers important implications for program developers and policy-makers to integrate these innovative educational approaches into both early childhood education and teacher education programs.

AB  - The integration of computational thinking (CT) to enhance creativity in design students has often been underexplored in design education. While design thinking has traditionally been the cornerstone of university design pedagogy and remains essential, the increasing role of digital tools and artificial intelligence in modern design practices presents new opportunities for innovation. By introducing CT alongside design thinking, students can expand their creative toolkit and engage with emerging technologies more effectively. Although many design students may have limited experience with programming, incorporating accessible, no-code tools can help them confidently embrace computational methods, unlocking new pathways for creative exploration and innovation. This study proposes an alternative approach to improve the motivation of design students by introducing machine learning tools into product design processes. We developed an experimental pedagogy in which 56 industrial design university students learned how to use Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (Weka), a machine learning tool, for three hours of design work a week, for a total of eight weeks. Our covariate analysis of data collected in the pretest and posttest shows that the general learning motivations in the group using Weka are significantly higher than those in the group without Weka. However, no significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of learning strategies, collaboration, or critical thinking. Students using Weka spent more time focusing on model training and tended to improve their algorithmic thinking, and the introduction of Weka appeared to enhance their motivation to learn. On the other hand, these students might have been focusing on working individually at their computers, potentially neglecting communication and collaboration. The findings suggest that teaching machine learning applications without requiring coding has the potential to boost design students' motivation to engage with CT skills, though care must be taken to maintain collaborative practices.

AB  - There is increasing effort to integrate Computational Thinking (CT) curricula across all education levels. Therefore, research on CT assessment has lately progressed towards developing and validating reliable CT assessment tools, which are crucial for evaluating students' potential learning progress and thus the effectiveness of suggested curricular programs. Several CT assessment tools were developed for elementary, high-school, and university students over the last years. Moreover, associations between CT scores and other cognitive abilities were unraveled. However, studies on the topic in primary school level are scarce. Like the general concept of intelligence, CT remains broadly defined as the ability to combine algorithmic operations to form complex solutions in order to solve problems effectively, utilizing concepts of computer science with or without the use of computers. In this study, we aimed at specifying a cognitive definition of CT, focusing on the under-investigated population of primary school children. Since validated assessment tools for this age group were not available, we adapted a validated CT test, which was initially designed for middle school students. In our study participated 192 third and fourth graders. The analyses revealed promising results on the reliability of the adapted CT assessment for primary school students. Moreover, findings indicated CT's positive associations with i. complex numerical abilities, ii. verbal reasoning abilities, and iii. non-verbal visuospatial abilities. Our results indicate similarities but also differences in associations of CT with other cognitive abilities in primary school children compared to other age groups. In summary: i. numerical abilities seem to associate with CT at the primary school level, whereas this seems not the case later on in education, ii. verbal abilities seem to associate with CT both along primary and secondary education levels, and iii. non-verbal reasoning abilities seem to associate with CT from primary education level to the university level and beyond. These differences imply that several basic cognitive abilities support CT abilities and CT development differentially across ages.

AB  - The concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI), born as the possibility of simulating the human brain's learning capabilities, quickly evolves into one of the educational technology concepts that provide tools for students to better themselves in a plethora of areas. Unlike the previous educational technology iterations, which are limited to instrumental use for providing platforms to build learning applications, AI has proposed a unique education laboratory by enabling students to explore an instrument that functions as a dynamic system of computational concepts. However, the extent of the implications of AI adaptation in modern education is yet to be explored. Motivated to fill the literature gap and to consider the emerging significance of AI in education, this paper aims to analyze the possible intertwined relationship between students’ intrinsic motivation for learning Artificial Intelligence during the COVID-19 pandemic; the relationship between students’ computational thinking and understanding of AI concepts; and the underlying dynamic relation, if existing, between AI and computational thinking building efforts. To investigate the mentioned relationships, the present empirical study employs mediation analysis based upon collected 137 survey data from Universidad Politécnica de Madrid students in the Institute for Educational Science and the School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering during the first quarter of 2022. Findings show that intrinsic motivation mediates the relationship between perceived Artificial Intelligence learning and computational thinking. Also, the research indicates that intrinsic motivation has a significant relationship with computational thinking and perceived Artificial Intelligence learning.

AB  - Computational thinking is widely recognized as an essential skill for adapting to the current era, with programming learning being the most effective means to develop it. It is recommended that computational thinking and learning programming be introduced as early as elementary school. However, elementary school students often possess limited prior knowledge of programming, posing challenges in their learning process. The graphic organizers (GOs) may serve as a bridge between students’ existing knowledge and new learning, facilitating a deeper processing of the overall information and thereby enhancing the learning process. This can be particularly advantageous for early-stage learners when grappling with difficult subjects. Consequently, this study employed GOs to assist elementary school students in their computational thinking and programming learning, employing a quasi-experiment design to evaluate their effectiveness. The results showed that although all students demonstrated awareness of applying computational thinking to solve problems, those exposed to GO-based instruction exhibited higher levels of computational thinking, programming skills, and flow experiences.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) practices is a critical cognitive tool for students to overcome challenges in this technological era. Few studies investigated CT practices from a development perspective. A two-year intervention was implemented in 30 intervention and 22 control schools in Hong Kong to promote CT education (T1baseline: N = 13,056; T2: N = 16,367; and T3: N = 15,269). Senior primary students (grades 4 to 6) around 8–12 years old were targeted. Among them, 34% were girls at T1baseline. Their learning progression of cognitive development was assessed with a CT practices test. Data were analyzed using item response analysis. Learning trajectories of CT practices were modeled to understand how students’ cognitive development differed between schools. Insights of findings were discussed in bringing CT practices to life.

AB  - Engagement is critical to computational thinking and programming education. However, as multi-dimensional variables, when analyzing how different aspects of engagement in computational thinking tasks influence skills development, it becomes crucial to discern precisely which engagement components intersect with the progression of computational thinking skills. This discernment is pivotal because engagement can vary based on the task nature, the context, and the individual's preferences. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the gender differences in engagement and computational thinking skills and the predictive relationships among these sub-dimensions for boys and girls in an unplugged environment. In this study, a quasi-experiment for 90 sixth-grade students from a north Chinese primary school was performed. By partial least squares–structural equation modeling, students’ models of computational thinking skills and engagement were analyzed, and comparisons of boys and girls were made by analysis of covariance statistics. Results indicated that compared with boys, girls reported higher computational thinking performance and more engagement in unplugged contexts. Furthermore, girls’ computational thinking skills were only predicted by their cognitive engagement, whereas boys’ computational thinking skills were predicted by their behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement. Teachers can adopt these findings to design computational thinking teaching interventions that combine the advantages of unplugged activity and focus on the engagement of boys and girls.

AB  - In this work, we argue for expanding the scope of K-12 computational thinking (CT) integration contexts to include everyday scenarios involving moral reasoning. Epistemic overlap between computational thinking practices and moral reasoning suggest that these contexts are potentially rich sites to see “seeds of CT” in children's reasoning and can provide rich educational pathways for children into CT. Taking a case-study approach, we examine the reasoning of a second-grader, Ollie, on a task involving fair allocation of resources to victims of a natural disaster. Our analysis finds that Ollie's reasoning was rich with seeds of CT (e.g., problem formulation, abstraction, complex-systems thinking) and that empathy served as an important supporting role to the CT. This work has implications for curricular design, suggesting that fairness and resource allocation scenarios with built-in opportunities for empathy might provide rich sandboxes for CT integration.

AB  - Although there are different definitions for computational thinking in the literature, it is possible to define it mainly as problem solving, designing and interpreting new systems by thinking like a computer. According to Wing (2006), computational thinking is a way of designing a system and understanding human behaviors by focusing on the basic concepts of the computer sciences. The recent focus on computational thinking as a key 21 st century skill for all students has led to a number of curriculum initiatives to embed it in K-12 classrooms and to introduce computing ideas to students early during their schooling years. The present study aims to explore the effects of a short, intensive coding and robotics training on the computational thinking skill self-efficacy of middle school students. 24 fifth graders participated in the study and data were collected by means of the Computational Thinking Self-efficacy scale (CTS) and one open-ended question. Analyses of the pre, post and delayed tests revealed significant differences between the pre and post-tests.

AB  - Methodological innovations across social sciences are opening new avenues for conducting research designed to address real-world challenges. The benefits of utilizing the Design-Based Implementation Research (DBIR) approach in public libraries to resolve a persistent problem of practice, a lack of assessment tools to evaluate youth Computational Thinking (CT) programs, is demonstrated. Findings from a three-year, three-phased study utilizing the DBIR approach to design and implement a suite of assessment tools to assess CT programming in public libraries are presented. Guided by the four principles of the DBIR approach, this research produced new knowledge, including identifying CT program outcomes, challenges, and recommendations for designing and implementing assessment tools to measure the impact of public libraries' CT programming. Findings underscore the DBIR approach as a strategy for engaging with practitioners and helping shift their perspectives by resolving practice problems and facilitating the design of sustainable solutions.

AB  - Although there is controversy surrounding rewards and competition in education, they are key elements in digital game-based learning (DGBL). Research on the influence of rewards and competition in DGBL often yields mixed results, suggesting a need to investigate individual game elements and their interactions. This study implemented DGBL focusing on computational thinking (CT) in 7th-grade classes. Both quantitative and behavioral data were collected to understand the impact of rewards (power-up or customization) and competition (with or without) on students’ intrinsic motivation, game performance, behaviors, and CT skills. The findings uncovered significant interactions between rewards and competition. Students with both competition and power-up rewards achieved the highest game points but the lowest CT performance, whereas those exposed to the same power-up rewards without competition attained the lowest game points but the best CT performance. Implications are drawn for DGBL research and practice.

AB  - Despite growing interest in early childhood computational thinking (CT), there is a lack of validated assessments for children who are emerging readers. This paper presents validity and reliability evidence of a performance-based assessment of CT using item response theory (IRT) from 272 children aged 4–8. Using a two-parameter logistic model IRT model (2PL IRT), we confirmed that model- and item-level fits are acceptable. Item analyses revealed a high discriminability (M = 2.26, SD = 1.12) and a moderate item difficulty (M = −0.21; SD = 0.86), on average, across 19 items. Reliability analysis demonstrated that the assessment was substantially reliable (marginal reliability: rxx = 0.87). Differential item functioning (DIF) analyses indicated that the assessment estimated children's item parameters fairly, regardless of their gender and age. However, we confirmed gaps in latent ability (θ) of CT by gender and age: boys showed higher latent ability of CT than girls, and old children (above 72 months) showed higher latent ability than young children (below 72 months). Findings suggest the assessment is a fair measure that can serve as a reliable and valid tool to assess CT for children who are emerging readers.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is an important and essential skill for human beings to master in the 21st century. Although CT has received wide attention since this concept was proposed, the current theoretical models have not well defined the complex relations between CT and other cognitive abilities for young children. To provide insight into this gap, the current study proposed a model in which we hypothesized that CT was significantly related to arithmetic fluency that is viewed as an important domain of mathematics. Additionally, arithmetic fluency was predicted to mediate the relations of CT to other cognitive abilities, including reasoning and creativity. This study tested such direct and indirect relations in children aged 5–6 years. Consistent with previous studies on older age groups, the results showed that CT and arithmetic fluency were significantly related to each other and both were significantly related to reasoning ability and creative thinking as well. Moreover, this study, for the first time, indicated that arithmetic fluency totally mediated the relation between CT and reasoning ability, suggesting that these concepts share conceptual commonalities, such as the cognitive processes related to mathematics or/and abstraction; in contrast, arithmetic fluency did not mediate the relation between CT and creative thinking, suggesting that gaining CT skill may exert direct positive effect on the development of creativity. Therefore, despite the root in computer science, CT is associated with many cognitive and learning abilities in other domains, supporting the importance of including CT into early school education.

Learning games offer the potential for innovative, stealth assessments of students' implicit learning from gameplay behaviors. This paper reports on the measurement of implicit CT practices demonstrated by upper elementary- and middle-school students as they play the CT learning game Zoombinis. The process of using the gameplay log data to build valid automated detectors of students' implicit CT practices is discussed. Findings from this study provide implications for analyzing gameplay behaviors at scale, leading to the development of models for the assessment of implicit STEM learning.

We report on the design, evaluation, and outcomes of the Computational Thinking Unplugged for Science (CT-UP-S) professional development program for inservice science teachers. Our process-based approach to CT significantly improved teachers CT understanding and CT/science integration self-efficacy by systematically linking CT practices to scaffold the generation of unplugged algorithms. Additionally, we found that the process-based approach provided a framework for teachers' lesson planning and that teachers’ content knowledge moderated their ability to write CT-integrated science lessons.

AB  - Early evidence suggests that robot programming offers an important foundation for spatial reasoning and computational thinking; however, researchers have debated how to introduce young children to these skills. We explored how preschoolers develop understanding of spatial concepts and computational thinking as the children took turns navigating a path during guided play with a programmable robot. Our analysis of the data included a multimodal visualization of the exchanges between the teacher, children, and a programmable robotic device. The findings highlight the effects that arose from the physical-digital convergence of technology integrated into play including: (a) the robot evoked a chain of actions, enacting pedagogic forces that transformed children's learning; (b) children used their own bodies as spatial referents, co-locating themselves in space with the robot; (c) the teacher remained a key actor, providing verbal and nonverbal scaffolding to promote children's understanding and mastery of spatial and computational concepts; and (d) talking with the teacher about spatial concepts combined with the interactions with the robot enhanced children's acquisition of spatial ideas relative to the quantity of children's verbal expressions and complexity of their applied spatial skills and computational thinking.

AB  - Workers in the areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics play a significant role in the sustained growth and stability of the global economy, and, thus constitute a critical component in helping all countries worldwide to prosper. In this context, computational thinking constitutes an important skill to have as it enables workers to develop creative solutions to complex problems. Nonetheless, across all economies worldwide, there is a need to have more workers who are able to think through problems, challenges, and solutions in computational terms. It is thus of utmost importance to integrate the teaching of computational thinking in K-12 education in order to reduce the skills gap between education and the workplace. A pertinent and crucial question that arises is whether teachers have the knowledge and skills to teach students how to think computationally. Existing research shows that teacher education departments do not currently have the knowledge to promote computational thinking in their programs. The present study focuses on two aspects of computational thinking, such as, algorithmic thinking and debugging skills with the use of scaffolded programming scripts in an educational technology undergraduate course. The results show statistically significant learning gains in pre-service teachers’ algorithmic thinking and debugging skills in the context of robotic programming activities with LEGO WeDo. Limitations and future research directions are discussed.

AB  - Recent studies identify Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) as a key factor in enhancing cognitive development, particularly within Computational Thinking (CT) literature. However, research gaps remain in understanding how SRL and CT interact from a developmental perspective. Our study designed a program with tailored animations and worksheets to specifically foster students' learning and cognitive development. Using a mixed-methods approach, we administered surveys among 1235 students from 29 Hong Kong primary schools to investigate a dynamic learning system comprising SRL and CT in a large-scale CT program. Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 students to further probe insights. Quantitative findings revealed a mutually reinforcing relationship in the dynamic system, suggesting that higher SRL skills enhance cognitive CT abilities, and vice versa. Complementing these results, qualitative findings showed that integrating animations and worksheets into the CT program significantly boosted students' SRL and cognitive development. These findings have significant implications for educational practices and curriculum design. Schools should consider implementing SRL strategies, such as proactive goal setting and reflective evaluation, within their curricula to promote students’ cognitive development. Furthermore, strategic investments in educational technology, including collaborations with EdTech developers, are essential to create effective, pedagogically sound tools that enhance learning outcomes. These insights provide valuable guidance for creating a supportive SRL environment that fosters cognitive development in primary school education.

AB  - In recent years, there has been increasing interest in integrating Computational Thinking (CT) into elementary schools. However, few studies have focused on teachers’ perceptions. This study aims to examine teachers' perceptions to bridge the gap between theory and practice. The study analysed teachers’ perceptions of integrating CT into school subjects through the constructionist approach, using Scratch a leading programming platform inspired by Resnick's Lifelong Kindergarten Constructionist model. Over a school year, 31 teachers participated in a professional development program and applied this model in their classrooms. The teachers were interviewed to capture their perceptions of learning and teaching using a constructionist method. The findings revealed that teachers with creative arts experience fully embraced the model, while others partially adopted it. Teachers recognized the benefits of constructionist teaching in fostering creativity, motivation, and engagement among students. However, they struggled with balancing these benefits with school demands and constraints. Challenges included managing time effectively within constraints of school and ensuring curriculum alignment. Despite this, many teachers found that the constructionist approach positively impacted students' learning engagement and personal development. By addressing the identified challenges, teacher education designers, curriculum developers, and schools can develop practices for closing the gap between theory and practice.

AB  - Educational research on predicting learners’ computer programming performance has yielded practical implications that guide task designs in computer education. There have been attempts to investigate learners’ computer programming patterns using high-frequency and automated data collection. This approach can be considered as process-based analysis as opposed to outcome-based analysis (i.e., the use of test or exam scores). In this process-based approach to investigate learners’ computer programming process, we included two critical constructs in our research, self-regulated learning and computational thinking skills. We aimed to identify learners’ computer programming patterns in the context that novice students learn a computer programming language, Python, in an online coding environment. We examined the relationships between the learners’ coding patterns, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills. Initially, we adopted a traditional approach with the aggregate data of learners’ computer programming behaviors. We then utilized a computational analytics approach to learner performance, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills, with ever-changing computer programming patterns. In our initial approach, the indicators of aggregate computer programming data were not associated with learners' learning performance and computational thinking skills. In the computational analysis approach, many indicators revealed significant differences between the identified patterns regarding computational thinking skills and self-regulated learning. Recommendations about the use of programming log data analysis methods and future scaffolding for computer programming learners are addressed.

AB  - In the field of education, research has consistently emphasized mathematical creative thinking as a crucial component of 21st-century skills. Thus, this cross-sectional study examines the predictors of such thinking by specifically focusing on the roles of perceived creativity, creative self-efficacy, and computational thinking. The participants consisted of 896 secondary school students (52.9 % female; 47.1 % male) in Indonesia who were asked to complete a series of online questionnaires and tests. For analysis, structural equation modeling was employed, demonstrating satisfactory construct validity and instrument reliability. Based on the results, there was a positive association between computational thinking and mathematical creative thinking. In addition, perceived creativity had a positive impact on mathematical creative thinking, whereas creative self-efficacy showed a negative association. As for the empirical model, it revealed that computational thinking plays a mediating role, connecting perceived creativity and creative self-efficacy to mathematical creative thinking. The findings suggest that incorporating these skills and related variables into the mathematics curriculums in schools is essential for preparing students for success in the 21st century.

AB  - Previous studies have explored the relationship between computational thinking (CT) and creativity. However, a consensus has yet to be reached since both CT and creativity varied in ideation and assessment. To uncover the cognitive mechanism underlying the interplay between CT and creativity, we conduct a scoping review of 26 empirical studies published in 2006–2024. Our findings suggested that the effects of working memory varied in the interplay between CT and creativity due to differences in age range, neural network activation regions, and measurements. Intellectual abilities, including algorithmic fluency, reasoning ability, and coding ability, showed cognitive transfer effect on CT skills but not necessarily on creativity, suggesting that cognitive abilities embracing more intelligent elements may contribute to the functional connectivity in CT neural networks but only partly overlapped with creativity involved networks. Although executive functions (working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control) play a crucial role in both CT and creativity, their contributions to the CT-creativity interplay are still rarely studied. Future research should explore the CT-creativity relationship from the perspective of neuroscience.

AB  - This systematic review examined how computer science (CS) education was implemented in schools and its efficacy for developing students’ computational thinking (CT). Sixty-six papers were selected for this systematic review and analyzed for patterns in relation to the implementation of CS education in K-12 schools and its impact on the development of students’ CT skills. Although educational interventions have not always been successful in CS education, this review provides strong evidence that overall, CS education promotes the development of students’ CT in the K-12 setting while improving their creative and critical thinking skills. We recommend early access to CS education, various innovative instructional approaches to CS education and appropriate support and guidance for student learning.

AB  - Recently, the development of computational thinking (CT) skills has become widespread in the whole world. There is a consensus to develop students’ CT skills through unplugged and plugged-in programming. However, the choice of programming approaches taught in schools is arbitrary and few studies have compared the effectiveness differences between unplugged and plugged-in programming. This study aimed to explore the differences between unplugged and plugged-in programming in developing CT skills of students in Grades 1-2 students. It also explored the joint effects of students’ gender, programming experience, programming interest, and programming confidence with different programming approaches on CT skills. The quasi-experimental research approach was used to conduct 10 weeks of unplugged, plugged-in, and regular programming activities with 124 Grades 1-2 students. The results found that unplugged programming promoted CT skills more in the early primary grades than plugged-in programming. We found that boys and students with programming experience in unplugged group performed significantly better in CT skills than in plugged-in group. Moreover, the improvement of CT skills of students in unplugged group was positively correlated with the level of their programming interest and programming confidence. However, these were not observed in plugged-in group. The results of this study can provide precise guidance for teaching CT skills to early primary school students and provide references for CT education.

AB  - This paper presents an investigation that compares and analyzes the interactions of three groups of pre-and-primary school children with three different storytelling systems. We identify emerging patterns through which they engaged in what we refer to as narrative computational thinking. The latter describes broadened aspects of narrative literacy practices that are linked to computational thinking. By applying a multicase study approach and through various vignettes, we illustrate how children applied computational thinking to understand and influence the narrative possibilities offered by the different tools. Our results illustrate circumstances under which digital storytelling activities provide a favorable basis for narrative computational thinking, and that when computational thinking functions as a scaffold for story creation, it encourages a blend of creativity and computational thinking, providing a compelling approach to introducing emerging digital literacies to young children in a narrative context.

AB  - In this study, it is aimed to identify the computational thinking skills used by gifted and talented students in integrated STEM activities based on the EDP. The case study design, a qualitative research method, is employed in the study. The participants consist of gifted and talented students attending the Science and Arts Center. Integrated STEM activities based on the EDP were conducted over the course of ten weeks and among these activities, robotic and 3D modeling-based robot construction activities using Lego sets are addressed in the present study. The STEM activity booklet, researchers' fieldnotes, and teaching process video recordings were used as data collection tools in the study. Data that was collected was analyzed through content analysis. It was seen that gifted and talented students participating in integrated STEM activities based on the EDP make active use of critical thinking skills while providing explanations, making associations, questioning information, giving justifications, solving problems, thinking creatively, making generalizations, and attempting to convince others; as for the instances of defining problems, creating solutions, and evaluating the effectiveness of the solution, the students were observed to actively use their problem-solving skills. The detailed account provided by the study on the way robotic and 3D robot modeling activities improve the computational thinking skills of gifted and talented students contributes to the required educational support and to the existing body of literature.

AB  - In the artificial intelligence age, cultivating young children's computational thinking (CT) has sparked tremendous attention. Programmable robotics is a developmental-appropriate and screen-free means that provides young children with great opportunities to learn programming and develop CT. However, it is reported that young children might have difficulties learning abstract CT concepts. As a helpful pedagogical facilitator, metaphors can help turn abstract concepts into more concrete and clear concepts that learners are familiar with. Therefore, this research proposed a metaphor-based robot programming (MRP) approach and explored its impact on young children's CT and behavioral patterns. A total of 118 children aged 5–6 were recruited in this experiment with two conditions: the experimental group adopted the metaphor-based robot programming (MRP) approach while the control group used the conventional robot programming (CRP) approach. Results revealed that children who adopted the MRP approach outperformed children who adopted the CRP approach on CT. In addition, behavioral analysis indicated that the proposed MRP approach could facilitate children's superior learning performance and more positive learning behaviors, so as to help them achieve learning objectives. Accordingly, this study can provide insightful guidance and inspiration for future research on effective programming teaching and CT development for young children.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is a necessary skill for students. It is as important as the other essential skills such as reading, writing, and arithmetic. However, how to improve students’ CT in robotics is still to be explored. Hence, this study examined the effects of computer supported project-based learning (CSPBL) on students’ CT and learning engagement through comparing students’ CT and engagement in two courses instructed by the same instructor (one instructed with a traditional method, the other instructed with CSPBL). Participants were seventy-nine students from a university in China. Questionnaires, interviews, and project analysis were used to measure students’ CT and learning engagement. The comparative results of self-reports and final projects indicated that the CSPBL enhanced students’ CT. The simulation project training based on the SenseStudy learning platform in CSPBL helped students debug the programming code, optimize the algorithm design, and improve their algorithmic thinking, cooperation, and problem solving during the program error correction. The CSPBL also improved students’ engagement in learning, especially for those with more than one year of programming experience. It was found that the CSPBL was effective in terms of improving students’ CT and engagement in robotics learning. This study provides teachers with practical suggestions to conduct effective robotics instruction.

AB  - Malaysia has introduced computational thinking skills as part of a curriculum integration update to meet the global trends in 21st-century education, focusing on empowering digital literacy. Nevertheless, a preliminary investigation revealed an apparent lack of understanding of computational thinking skills in general among teachers. The study explores the feasibility of developing a localized E-learning system to train computational thinking skills among teachers. An E-learning system, termed as myCTGWBL, was developed on the basis of a newly proposed conceptual framework to present computational thinking teaching–learning repertoire to the teachers. The hypothesis is that myCTGWBL would develop teachers' computational thinking and its position in teaching–learning understanding. myCTGWBL relevance was tested through DeLone and McLean's information system and Urbach's collaboration quality construct. To determine the success factors, partial least squares structural equation modeling was used. A total of 369 teachers participated in a two-stage survey. Participants' understanding of computational thinking and perceptions were recorded at the pre- and post-intervention phases. Open-ended questions of the surveys were analyzed using a simple text analysis technique. The closed-ended questions surveys were analyzed using SPSS Statistics 22.0. A significant improvement in teachers' computational thinking teaching–learning repertoire in a relatively short period has been recorded. Teachers also demonstrated increased confidence in the future delivering computational thinking-based lessons. The E-learning conceptual framework has illustrated the predictive power between user intent, user satisfaction, and Computational thinking (CT) knowledge benefits. Results demonstrate that myCTGWBL could be used to guide future planning when establishing CT knowledge acquisition initiatives, particularly among teachers.

AB  - Efforts to incorporate computational thinking (CT) into academic courses have been gaining popularity. CT is a problem-solving skill that is crucial in the 21st century. CT may be used to support language education. Courses in English as a foreign language often need an effective writing component that includes writing organization and language use, as demonstrated by the poor writing samples often generated by students of these courses. To address the problems, CT, which is a higher-order mode of problem-solving and knowledge acquisition optimization, was used. The experimental group was instructed using the CT teaching model based on CT's essential components (decomposition, generalization, abstraction, algorithm, and evaluation), whereas the control group was taught using the conventional method. In total, 58 undergraduate students divided into two groups participated in this study. A combination of writing, CT skills, surveys, and interviews were used to collect data according to an experimental design. The collected quantitative data were analyzed through analysis of covariance and structural equation modeling, and the MAXQDA 2022software was used to analyze the collected qualitative data. The results of this study indicate that incorporating CT into an English writing course enhances the writing and higher-order thinking skills of students. The CT concepts helps students develop critical thinking skills by evaluating the text and identifying potential issues or improvements. Additionally, it allows students to use their skills to create unique writing solutions, which can boost English writing creativity.

AB  - Computational thinking education has become an increasingly popular topic among practitioners and researchers. However, rare is known how to effectively teach and learn computational thinking in early childhood education. To address this knowledge gap, this systematic review examined 26 studies on the teaching and learning of computational thinking in early childhood education from 2010 to 2022. The content knowledge, tools, pedagogical design, assessment methods, and learning outcomes were analyzed. Results indicated that, with age-appropriate instructional design, children could develop early concepts and skills of computational thinking, as well as other related skills such as communication, collaboration, and problem solving. Across the studies, we found that most studies used quantitative research methods, with direct assessment and observation being the most. Several challenges were identified: (1) achieving a deeper learning of computational thinking; (2) a lack of valid and reliable computational thinking assessments for children with a wider age range; (3) selecting appropriate learning tools; and (4) designing age-appropriate activities for young learners. Although with these challenges, computational thinking education could bring new learning opportunities and enhance children's computational thinking skills, as well as other non-cognitive skills such as critical thinking, body-material interaction, and hand-eye coordination. This systematic review informs future endeavors in theorizing a digital learning framework that can integrate computational thinking into early childhood education.

AB  - Teacher competencies encompass the dimensions of knowledge and attitudes, yet few studies have analysed teachers' latent profiles in relation to the interaction between these two dimensions. Latent profile analysis, which examines the interplay between variables to distinguish subgroups of individuals, has recently emerged in studies of computational thinking (CT) as a method for identifying student profiles. However, the latent profiles of CT teachers have not yet been analysed. We therefore analysed the latent profiles of a sample of 493 teachers who had participated in a teacher development programme in CT, according to their knowledge and perceived usefulness of CT. Three profiles were identified: (1) highly knowledgeable with high perceived usefulness, (2) knowledgeable with low perceived usefulness, and (3) less knowledgeable with low perceived usefulness. Qualitative data further triangulated these findings. We also examined the learning achievement of 12,105 students taught by these teachers. Students taught by highly knowledgeable teachers with a high perceived sense of usefulness demonstrated significantly better achievement than their peers. Our findings highlight the importance of nurturing both knowledge of and perceived usefulness in CT. They also provide valuable insights for similar teacher development programmes, emphasizing the importance of peer mentoring support for less knowledgeable teachers. Additionally, we underscore the value of having teachers create artefacts using CT for instructional purposes, allowing them to gain firsthand experience of its usefulness. As few studies have explored teachers' latent profiles based on the dimensions of knowledge and attitudes, the contribution of this study extends beyond the domain of CT.

AB  - We designed a controlled trial protocol that seeks to contribute to cognitive science by studying the effect of thought training on children's executive functions. The study design is a cluster randomized controlled trial, with intra-subject and inter-subject evaluation, with two parallel groups: an experimental group and a TAU control group. With three measures, pre-test, post-test, and follow-up after three months. The participants will be children aged 9 to 11. The allocation will be randomized by groups and not individually. The sample will be a minimum of 44 participants. The primary measures will be neuropsychological tests to assess executive functions. Secondary measures will be a computational thinking test, neuropsychological tests to assess metacognition and attention, and an acceptability scale. The experimental group will participate in the COGNI-MACHINE computational thinking training designed by the first author. The training frequency will be twice a week in 60 min sessions for 12 weeks. The TAU control group will receive computer science classes as usual during the same time as the experimental group. The evaluators taking the measurements will be blinded to the assignment. The investigators in charge of the intervention will be blinded to the results of the evaluations.

AB  - Negative feedback can temporarily relieve negative Chinese transfer (NCT) in English as a foreign language (EFL) syntactic writing by focusing only on the surface writing constructs, neglecting that EFL writing is an embodiment of the process by which higher-order thinking operates. To solve the problem, the researchers conducted a pretest, interventionist group dynamic assessment (IGDA) in the form of negative feedback based on computational thinking (CT), higher-order thinking, and post-test quasi-experimental design, with a control group receiving the direct correction feedback instructing model to mitigate the NCT in EFL syntactic writing. We analyzed the syntactic writing types and frequencies of the NCT obtained through repeated-measure ANOVA and confirmed by qualitative data through video recording. The results indicated that IGDA in the form of negative feedback based on CT principal skills could (1) significantly decrease syntactic writing errors caused by the NCT, (2) improve learners’ EFL writing performance, and finally, (3) elevate the computer as an essential mediation tool. This innovative instructing mode of intervening with writing constructs and higher-order thinking and bringing about deeper thinking and creativity contributes to the EFL writing teaching methodology in a foreign language higher education.

AB  - The tenure system in the United States places significant importance on teaching effectiveness. To date, students' evaluations of teaching (SETs) have been the reigning mechanism for assessing effective teaching. However, prior work has shown that SETs are often biased against underrepresented groups and minorities. The present study analyzes options for effective teaching assessments, which include evaluating final grades and measuring the differences between students’ pre- and post-tests (normalized gain) using standard instruments. The content area and the instrument used in this study originated in the computational thinking field, which has a widespread presence in engineering, where minorities are at a disadvantage. This study obtained a total of 88 student participants from four sections of an introductory engineering course at a Southwestern institution. The study utilized a computational thinking diagnostic (CTD) to inform the course teaching approach (the intervention). Results show that (a) normalized learning gains correlated moderately with SETs, (b) final grades correlated strongly with SETs, (c) final grades correlated strongly with normalized learning gains, (d) the educational intervention based on the CTD significantly affected student learning, and (e) SET comments affect evaluations. The implications include the notion that standardized instrument-driven instruction and evaluations can increase the success of minorities on both sides of the classroom. The purpose of this manuscript is to invite the Heliyon readership to get involved in the development of related instruments and to incorporate these measures of learning into their instruction so biases are avoided or minimized.

AB  - In the digital age, our lives become more dependent on technology, yet the digital gap is intensifying especially because most people lack digital literacy. As a modest step to handle this challenge, we designed a course named "Play with me in Code" to develop pre-service teachers' (PSTs) thinking skills and expose them to learning by creation using computational thinking and programming as part of the constructionism paradigm. The added value of using Scratch in the context of teacher education lies not only in familiarity with a programming language but with an emphasis on experiencing self-directed learning tackling with problem solving situations, creativity, socioemotional competencies, and logical computational thinking. The present study aims to examine 25 PSTs' attitudes towards facing challenges of coding with Scratch. To this end, a mixed-method approach was activated by using questionnaires, blog posts, and reflections. Findings revealed that the learning environment encouraged PSTs' use of abstraction and decomposition to address a complex problem or to design a complex game. Study's conclusions relate to the importance of providing PSTs opportunities to experience learning by programming for raising their awareness of the importance of enhancing thinking skills and creativity in the future.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT), a way to think about solving problems, is recognized as a basic skill for the 21st century. Although game-based learning (GBL) has been shown to improve student's CT skills, students may fail to self-evaluate or debate as they play games, thus failing to develop higher-order thinking. Also not widely explored is how teachers are to practice the CT core competencies during the learning process to cultivate students' problem-solving thinking. As the adoption of student-generated questions (SGQ) is an instructional strategy to promote higher-order thinking, we develop a GBL platform that uses this strategy to enhance students' CT skills, learning motivation, and learning confidence. For this purpose, fifty-three primary school students were recruited for this study, and data were collected during four classes of experimental CT activities. This study shows that the experimental group using the SGQ strategy with a GBL platform exhibited significantly higher CT skills than the control group. In addition, with respect to learning motivation and learning confidence it is found that the experimental group also outperformed the control group. This confirms that integrating the SGQ strategy and CT core competencies fosters higher-order cognitive thinking in students in problem-solving through gamification of the learning environment, resulting in higher motivation and confidence to complete experimental activities.

AB  - To effectively utilize artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies such as ChatGPT and realize their novel ethical issues, individuals must have a variety of knowledge and skills about AI. Such knowledge and skills have led to the emergence of AI literacy. Despite the importance of AI literacy in everyday life, little is known about its determinants. To better understand the determinants of AI literacy, we attempted to build a research model relying on previous research and different theoretical frameworks. The model incorporated digital divide, cognitive absorption, and computational thinking. As a major finding from the current study, computational thinking was found to be a significant determinant of AI literacy, which facilitate using, recognizing, and evaluating AI-based technologies. Moreover, we found out that individuals with physical access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) are more expected to use and recognize AI. Also, motivation and skills in using ICTs enable individuals to better evaluate the outcomes of AI-based technologies. The findings also showed that convenient access to ICTs contributes to a deep involvement with AI-based technologies in the use. Further, individuals with higher motivation and skills to use AI technologies are likely to have a pleasant experience after using these technologies.

AB  - Both computational thinking (CT) and creativity have been recognized as key skills for today's learners. Over the last decade, research of both skills in a single context has emerged. In this paper, we present a scoping review of 62 such empirical from 2011 to 2020. Our goal was to have a thorough understanding of the educational settings in which research on both CT and creativity was conducted, the theoretical foundations it has laid down, and the research tools used. Our findings indicate a geographical bias (dominance of the US and prominence of developed European countries), as well as a focus on secondary education and on STEM-related disciplines; this could be explained by the current situation of CT spread. We also found that when studying CT and creativity jointly, it is most common to define CT in a broader perspective than merely programming of computer science. Additionally, while creativity is largely referred to as product-related, CT is barely referred to as such. Taken together, our findings point out some gaps in the current research of CT and creativity and suggest how it should be expended on the fertile grounds of creativity, as the latter crosses geographical, age, and subject borders. Doing so may build a bridge between CT and creativity in a way that will benefit both.

AB  - This paper sheds light on 3–5-year-old children’s enactments of computational empowerment (CE) in activities with computational thinking (CT). CT is widely elaborated on as a universal problem-solving approach and a skill set necessary for thriving in today’s digitized societies. Scholars claim that CT for all should be ensured from an early age, and several studies develop and examine age-appropriate technological tools, as well as pedagogical approaches, for young children’s learning of CT. Based on 1.5 years of co-designing for children’s situated CT in two Danish kindergartens, the present study conducts a socioculturally informed analysis of video-observed interactions between children and educational robots. The findings display how children and robots engage in interactions that transcend children’s mastery of CT in any narrow sense. This is examined as situated enactments of CE; as children’s critical and informed decisions regarding the roles that technologies, in this case educational robots, can play in their institutionally situated social lives. The paper concludes that children’s various enactments of CE deserve scholarly and professional attention, both as an important prerequisite for, and as a necessary limitation to, the implementation of CT in kindergartens.

AB  - Since the end of the 20th century, the digitalization of society, including the educational systems, has been growing exponentially. At the same time, education systems have been evolving towards competency-based assessment. Likewise, at the beginning of this century, the idea of Computational Thinking was resurrected by J. Wing, for solving problems and designing systems using concepts of computer science. Today, we can see how all these questions are taking shape in a new competence, called Computational Thinking, related to others that already exist. In this paper, we have studied the skills of Computational Thinking in university students, focusing on abstraction and its possible relationship with other factors. Results conclude that the students fail in relation to abstraction and in algorithmic thinking. Although the ability of abstraction is not easy to measure, a linear regression analysis has been carried out in order to determine its possible study.

AB  - Teaching computational thinking (CT) has become a priority for educators and policymakers tasked with educating and training students for future jobs which are predicted to be increasingly automated. Recent research on effective instructional interventions for developing computational thinking skills, including algorithmic and critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity, and cooperativity, suggests that teaching and learning CT can improve student academic performance. In fact, the extant literature is quite sanguine about the topic of CT. However, few studies have attempted to establish a relationship between CT skills and academic performance. In the present cross-sectional study, we employ path analysis to model the structural relationship between self-reported CT skills and academic performance of a sample of 81 computer science undergraduates enrolled at a Southwestern American university. We found few direct relationships between CT skills and academic performance. We only find a significant positive relationship between creativity and academic performance and a significant negative relationship between cooperativity and academic performance. Our findings are surprising considering the abundant research promoting computational thinking as a key component of 21st century skills. The findings call for further in-depth analysis of computational thinking and the influence on students’ learning and learning outcomes. We discuss our results with respect to recent educational mandates for including CT and instructional alignment in school curricula. Our findings contribute to the existing discussion by helping to clarify the relationship between CT skills and academic performance in higher education.

AB  - Although studies have shown that computational thinking (CT) can enhance learning processes and outcomes across traditional subjects, they have not shown how teachers might scaffold children's CT processes in a technology-mediated learning context. This exploratory study examined how teacher talk and technologies impacted the CT of three children (6 to 8 years old). Seven videotaped 90-minute sessions of weekly project-based activities yielded 4,842 turns of talk (2,974 by children). Statistical discourse analysis revealed the following results. After a teacher command, the children more often executed a sequence of actions toward a solution but less often demonstrated problem understanding than otherwise. Following a teacher's open question, the children were more likely to offer logically organized ideas. In response to a teacher's rhetorical question, they more often searched for information. These results inform educators regarding when to use each type of teacher talk to scaffold children's CT processes.

AB  - ChatGPT (generative pre-trained transformer) is one of the artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that have started to be used in programming education. However, the effect of using ChatGPT in programming education on learning processes and outcomes is not yet known. This study investigated the effect of programming education using the ChatGPT on students' computational thinking skills, programming self-efficacy, and motivation toward the lesson. The research was conducted on 45 undergraduate students who took a university-level programming course. The research was carried out according to the experimental design with the pretest-posttest control group. Students were randomly divided into experimental (n = 21) and control (n = 24) groups. While the experimental group students benefited from the ChatGPT during the weekly programming practices, the control group students did not use this tool. Research data were obtained through the computational thinking scale, computer programming self-efficacy scale, and learning motivation in computer programming courses scale. Research findings revealed that the experimental group students' computational thinking skills, programming self-efficacy, and motivation for the lesson were significantly higher than the control group students. In line with this result, it can be said that it may be useful to benefit from AI technologies such as ChatGPT in programming trainings. The research findings, it was emphasized how the most effective use of AI support in the lessons could be made, and various suggestions were made for researchers and educators in this regard.

AB  - In this paper, we explore how the theoretical notion of possibility space offers a way to study how children's computational thinking develops as a process. Drawing on embodied notions of cognition, we first examine the literature that supports how children's computational thinking emerges as a possibility space that involves conceptualizing possible actions in a given moment, deciding which action to take by anticipating the results of a possible action, and learning from the actions that they have taken. We then use a grounded approach to analyze the problem-solving process of two 5th-grade children who engaged in an educational robotics activity over two 50-minute class periods. The findings lend support for approaching children's computational thinking as a cycle of action-taking that includes conceptualizing, anticipating, and taking action. The findings also support the pedagogical practice of having children predict the results of a computer program to enhance their computational thinking. Implications for the way that teachers can support children in learning to conceptualize what is possible and take action from it are discussed.

AB  - Predictive learner modelling is crucial for personalized education. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great success in education, their potential in learner modelling via image data is unexplored. This research introduces a novel and interpretable approach for Image-based Learner Modelling (ImageLM) using CNNs and transfer learning to model learners’ performance and accordingly classify their computational thinking solutions. The approach integrates Grad-CAM, enabling it to provide insights into its decision-making process. Findings show that our custom CNN outperforms other models (namely ResNet, VGG, and Inception), with 83% accuracy in predicting solution correctness. More importantly, the ImageLM approach identifies the regions that contribute the most to the predictions, shedding light on learners' computational thinking knowledge and advancing toward trustworthy AI for education. These results underline the potential of utilizing imagery data from learners’ activities during the learning process to predict their performance, especially in challenging environments like programming where traditional feature extraction and learning might struggle.

AB  - The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has led to the proliferation of computational thinking (CT) education. However, research on unplugged activities’ influence in elementary math classrooms is limited, despite some exploring programming's cognitive benefits. This study presents both qualitative and quantitative analyzes stemming from a ten-week quasi-experimental research endeavor, specifically tailored for third-grade students. The research devised a series of unplugged activities, encompassing mathematical games, hands-on construction of mathematical logic boards, and calculating shopping discounts. The overarching objective was to investigate the impact of these unplugged activities on students’ mathematical creativity and CT. Students participating in a mathematics curriculum based on unplugged activities (N = 47) were compared with students participating in a traditional lecture-based mathematics curriculum (N = 46). The results indicated that unplugged activities exhibited significant advantages in fostering students’ CT and mathematical creativity across three dimensions, namely, problem-posing creativity (t = 5.830, p < 0.01), problem-solving creativity (t = 6.633, p < 0.01), and creative self-efficacy (t = 7.554, p < 0.01). Furthermore, the study revealed a relationship between students’ mathematical creativity as a predictor of CT. The results of the quantitative analysis were supported by the teacher's and students’ interview data, and the students felt excited and interested in the unplugged activities, whereas some students using the lecture-based method reported boredom and lack of interactivity. This research offered valuable insights for mathematics and CT education practice, underscoring unplugged activity as an innovative instructional approach that brings forth new possibilities for traditional mathematics teaching, with potential applications in the K-12 curriculum.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has received worldwide attention due to its alignment with developing 21st century skills such as creativity, problem-solving, and digital competence. With the increasing provision of programming tools such as robotic toys and tablet apps in the sector of early childhood education (ECE), many ECE researchers and practitioners tend to link CT to programming. However, children are reluctant to sustain their interests in programming activities, and may be further demotivated by debugging failures. This multi-group quasi-experimental study aimed to evaluate the effects of a story-inspired approach in bridging the gap between programming and CT for preschool children. Building on previous literature suggesting storytelling as a powerful, culturally responsive pedagogy, 5-year-old children (N=108) were involved in nine weeks of CT learning via one of the three conditions: Story-Inspired Robot Programming (SIRP), Story-Inspired Tablet Programming (SITP), and unplugged CT education. Results revealed that children who participated in the SIRP and SITP conditions showed improved CT scores, relative to unplugged CT education, even after controlling for baseline CT scores. No gender or family socioeconomic effects were found to influence the benefits of story-inspired programming interventions. These findings suggest that storytelling as a culturally responsive approach, whether using robots or tablets as a programming tool, can provide young children with more inclusive and sustainable CT learning experiences.

AB  - Content area K-12 teachers are increasingly asked to integrate computing and computational thinking into their classrooms, yet they often have little experience with computing. The purpose of this study was to understand how science teachers, new to computing and integrating computational thinking into their classrooms, supported students as computational problem solvers. In the project from which this research was drawn, 8th grade science teachers in three US school districts integrated computer game design into their study of climate systems and climate change. We conducted participant observation, collected teacher implementation logs and interviewed 15 teachers engaged in the three-year design research project, Building Systems from Scratch. Analysis through grounded theory yielded several results related to teachers’ orientations, strategies, and use of resources to create systems of distributed expertise. We identified five major themes: a) releasing responsibility to students, b) co-learning with students, c) encouraging students’ independent problem solving, d) building interdependence among students, and e) providing multiple other resources. Findings are discussed in relation to the literature on integrating computational thinking into content area classrooms.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is currently used as an umbrella term in education to describe the processes associated with learning and applying computer science concepts and strategies for problem-solving. Despite a growing body of literature on the subject within education and the development of a grand variety of tools designed to enhance computational thinking abilities, the relations between CT and other cognitive abilities have not been reported in young children. Understanding CT from a cognitive development perspective could be useful for creating targeted interventions tailored for young children. In the present study, we compare a previously reported computational thinking assessment with a battery of nine cognitive tests, which include fluid intelligence, working memory, planning, sequencing, mental rotation, vocabulary, and early math precursors such as numerical transcoding and symbolic magnitude comparison. Mixed-effects linear regressions were implemented with CT as a dependent variable to explore the associations between our variables. A subsample of children who participated in an educational robotics intervention were assessed in their robot programming performance, and its outcomes were compared with their CT assessments. Results suggest temporal sequencing ability and symbolic magnitude comparison are significant predictors of CT in kindergarten. Positive significant associations between robot programming and CT performance are reported.

AB  - The research aims to evaluate the effect of a robotics-based computational thinking program on executive functions and visuospatial skills in preschool children. Additionally, the study will explore the relationship between these three variables and early experiences with toys. The study will be a cluster-randomized controlled trial with pre- and post-intervention measures. Participants will be preschool children aged 5 to 6 years from both public and private institutions. The intervention will involve a new educational robotics device called ROVERSA and will consist of eight sessions distributed over four weeks, with the experimental group placed on a waitlist. To assess executive functions and visuospatial skills, standardized and validated neuropsychological measures will be used, including the Flanker task, the NIH Toolbox Card Sorting Test, the Corsi Block Test, the NEPSY-II Mental Rotation Test, the Pyramid of Mexico from the ENI-2 battery, and the Computational Thinking Test (CTt). Data analysis will begin with a hypothesis tested through ANOVA-MR, and linear regressions will be implemented to assess the relationship between variables. It is expected that the results will contribute to the discussion on teaching computational thinking and educational robotics as early learning experiences and their impact on the cognitive development of children.

AB  - This study examined the impact of a 10-month STEM professional development (PD) program on 25 teachers working with gifted students. The program aimed to enhance pedagogical knowledge and competencies. Findings indicated significant positive improvements in teachers' STEM self-efficacy, computational thinking, and entrepreneurship skills. The PD program also had a direct positive influence on the quality of lesson plans. The study suggests that effective PD design should incorporate scientific inquiry, engineering design processes, computational thinking, entrepreneurship skills, and the development of teachers' self-efficacy for successful implementation of PD outcomes in STEM education.

AB  - Educators emphasize that computational thinking is especially helpful in raising problem-solving skills, improving logical reasoning, and developing analytical thinking. In this context, the aim of this study is to develop an online, interactive, valid, reliable and useful performance-based assessment tool for measuring computational thinking skills. Data were collected in two stages with three different measurement tools. In the data collection phase, a psychometric scale, a skill test and an interactive web application developed in this study were used. In the study in which a total of 203 high school students participated, it was determined that the students' computational thinking skills were at average level. as a result, a valid and reliable performance-based platform was developed for measuring computational thinking skills. It has also been concluded that the performance-based measurement tool makes a better measurement than the psychometric scale. It is emphasized that computational thinking should be treated as a skill or group of skills, not as a theoretical knowledge, product/portfolio or attitude/perception. Therefore, it is believed that developing performance-based tools for evaluating computational thinking skills and measuring them by using multiple measurement tools will give more accurate results. Considering the developments in computational thinking, it is thought that the study will contribute to the literature.

AB  - Computing education has progressively entered into children's early years. Due to a proliferation of computing education programs and coding tools designed for young children, research on the relationships between computational thinking (CT) and other domains of learning and development is highly warranted. Yet, there is little empirical evidence that shows the relationship between CT and children's overall cognitive functioning. As such, this study explored the relationships between Chinese children's CT and their sequencing ability and self-regulation in early childhood. One hundred and one Chinese young children (Ngirl = 52 and Nboy = 49; Mage = 5.25, SD = 0.73) were recruited and evaluated with three reliable instruments. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that: (1) CT positively predicted sequencing ability (β = 0.27, p < .05) even after controlling for relevant demographic covariates such as age, gender, and family socioeconomic status; (2) CT positively predicted self-regulation (β = 0.47, p < .001) after controlling for demographic covariates. Our findings suggest that CT may be a domain-general ability that is based on cognitive foundations that extend beyond the realm of computing.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is regarded as the conceptual basis required for identifying and solving real-world problems through algorithmic approaches to achieve transferable solutions. Developing students' CT in primary school stages is essential and has received considerable attention. Meanwhile, researchers incorporated digital badges into classrooms to improve students' learning motivation in computer science (CS). However, few solid empirical studies analyze the effects of the digital badges approach in CS education to develop students' CT. Therefore, to bridge this gap, this study designed and implemented a block-based programming course in a primary school and examined the impact of the digital badges approach on pupils' CT skills and self-efficacy and learning motivation in CS. A quasi-experimental design was conducted among 99 third-grade students across three classes. The results revealed that the adapted digital badges in primary school (1) significantly improved the students' CT skills, (2) had no significant positive impact on their CT self-efficacy or learning motivation in CS, and (3) showed no mediating effect of learning motivation on the relationship between CT skills and CT self-efficacy. In addition, we found that whether students could see only their own digital badges or also those of others had no impact on CT skills, self-efficacy, or learning motivation in CS. These findings have implications for the design of digital badge educational interventions intended to promote students' CT and learning motivation.

AB  - Computational thinking refers to a series of cognitive processes involved in solving problems through computational systems. A growing body of studies has managed to demonstrate the correlation between computational thinking and different cognitive domains. In recent decades, multiple studies have taken place that seek to evaluate the effect of computational thinking on higher-order cognitive processes. The current study aims to contribute to this discussion by analyzing the effect of an intervention program in computational thinking on the executive functions of school-age children. In this experimental study, 30 children aged 10 and 11 were randomly assigned to an experimental group and an active control group. The instruments to collect the data were 15 tests of the neuropsychological battery of executive functions and frontal lobes BANFE-2, which were applied to both groups before and after the intervention. The experimental group participated in an 8-week computational thinking intervention during which its participants enrolled in plugged and unplugged activities and carried out block programming language twice a week. The results showed that the intervention had significant effects on executive functions associated with the anterior prefrontal cortex and the dorsolateral cortex, but not those related to the orbitofrontal area.

AB  - Learning coding during early childhood is an effective way for children to practice computational thinking. Aspects of children's motivation can increase the likelihood that children approach computational thinking activities with enthusiasm and deep engagement. Gender inequities may interfere with children's readiness to take advantage of opportunities to build computational thinking skills through activities such as coding. Societal stereotypes can reduce young girls’ motivation to engage with computer science, preventing them from gaining benefits from coding activities designed to support computational thinking. This study examined children's gender stereotypes as well as children's own motivation for computer coding in 363 first- through third-grade children. We assessed gender differences in both stereotypes and motivation, as well as links between the stereotypes that individual children held and their own motivation. Children generally endorsed stereotypes about interest and ability for computer coding that favored their own-gender group, although third-grade girls reported gender-egalitarian beliefs about interest in coding. There were no gender differences in children's motivation for computer coding in terms of their own interest, sense of belonging, or ability self-concepts. Children's stereotypes about their own-gender group were significantly positively correlated with their own motivation for computer coding. These findings suggest that early childhood represents an excellent age for children to begin building computational thinking skills, before girls endorse negative stereotypes about their gender's interest in computer science.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is an essential skill students need if they are to adapt to the rise of digital society, and the evaluation of CT is crucial for enhancing students’ CT. However, the current evaluation of CT is based on a summative paradigm and ignores real CT performance during the assessment process. This study thus used a multimodal cognitive diagnostic model (H-MCDM) of students’ CT based on multimodal data in situational tasks, to achieve precise evaluation and explore the current mastery status of students’ CT and their cognitive and behavioral characteristics. The research results indicate that: 1) students’ CT was at a moderately high level and indicated a good grasp of the CT components of problem decomposition and algorithm design, but students had not yet mastered problem abstraction, 2) a total of six different CT latent patterns were discerned in the overall student results, 3) individual students who shared the same CT latent patterns could differ in their cognitive and behavioral characteristics, while those with different CT latent patterns could share similar characteristics. This study showed that it is possible to capture the degree of students’ mastery of CT and their cognitive and behavioral differences with the same or different CT latent patterns at a granular level, providing a basis for developing individualized strategies to enhance students’ CT.

AB  - In-service elementary school teachers need training to teach computational thinking (CT). A common model for CT professional learning programs includes an initial workshop followed by ongoing support. However, little research has examined the efficacy of ongoing support, the most effective types, and its impact on classroom practices. The current study details a multifaceted CT professional learning program with innovative ongoing support to help elementary school teachers implement the Code.org curriculum. It also empirically investigated the impact of the support on teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT, the effectiveness of each component of the support, and to what extent it affected teachers' classroom practices. Our ongoing support included an additional workshop, grade-level professional learning community (PLC) sessions, instructional videos, and teacher leaders' support. Data included a pre-survey, four post-surveys, lesson observations, a focus group interview, tracking the number of video views, and surveys from PLC participants and teacher leaders. Results indicated that the ongoing support significantly increased teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT. Regarding the effectiveness of the various components of the ongoing support, the additional workshop significantly increased teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT. Teachers valued each component of the support, and this support improved teachers’ classroom practices.

AB  - The present study investigates the debugging process of 526 children in preschool (4–6 aged) when programming a tangible robot. When a child is involved in programming, it is needed to identify and correct errors, or in other words, debug a program. Debugging is a high-level thinking skill and is an essential component closely related to developing Computational Thinking in early childhood education. Though the debugging process is a cognitive function in programming investigated by many researchers in recent decades, most studies are conducted either in primary, secondary education, or higher education concerning beginners or experts in programming. Very few reviews, and some focus on preschool education. Our study set out the following objectives: 1) How do children identify the existence of error and locate it? 2) What types of errors emerge when coding? 3) What type of error is complex for novice programmers? 4) What strategies are developed by novice programmers to debug effectively? and 5) What types of knowledge do novice programmers construct by debugging the tangible robot Bee-Bot? The study follows an iterative model of a design-based research approach. It uses multiple case studies to collect qualitative and quantitative data. The programming intervention was implemented by 30 educators in their classrooms and was based on a scenario-based teaching design. The debugging process was analysed using Klahr & Craven's framework (1988): 1) test and evaluate program, 2) identify bug, 3) represent program, 4) locate bug and 5) correct bug. The main finding is the construction and development of syntactic and semantic knowledge.

AB  - A plethora of programming platforms purports to teach preschool-aged children computational thinking (CT) and coding skills. However, the empirical evidence to support their effectiveness is still in its early stages. A three-week didactic intervention using ScratchJr was conducted to investigate its effectiveness in fostering CT and rudimentary coding skills in a cohort of preschool children (N = 34, aged 4–6 years). While the initial performance mean of the control group (M = 7.07, SD = 2.58) exhibits a statistically significant elevation t (22.64 = 2.23, p = 0.036) vis-à-vis the experimental group (M = 5.35, SD = 1.58), t (22.64) = 2.23, p = 0.0 the terminal performance means of both groups converge closely. However, meticulous data analysis unveils a statistically notable enhancement among preschool participants exposed to the educational intervention involving ScratchJr. Notably, both instructional modalities appear commensurate in nurturing elementary computational tenets, namely modularity and control structures. The experimental cohort outperforms the control group with statistical significance in comprehending potent ideational constructs encompassing representation, algorithms, and hardware/software interplay. Conversely, the control group performs better in grasping the debugging concept than their experimental counterparts. The outcomes lend substantive credence to the efficacy of the distinct programming milieu offered by ScratchJr, underscoring its effectiveness in cultivating CT and coding proficiencies within the preschool demographic.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is crucial for students. Robot-supported learning has emerged as a popular approach for CT cultivation. To understand the effects of robot-supported CT cultivation, the current study conducted a meta-analysis to analyze studies from Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Science Direct databases (2012–2022) which screened using keywords ``computational thinking'' and ``robot''. After further screening, 26 peer-reviewed articles were selected. We synthesized the 33 effect sizes to assess the overall effectiveness of robot-supported learning on CT and its sub-dimensions: concepts, practices, and perspectives. Our findings revealed a medium effect of robot-supported learning on students' CT (g = 0.643), a large effect on CT concepts (g = 0.650), a medium effect on CT practices (g = 0.587), and a huge effect on CT perspectives (g = 1.419). We also explored the moderators (i.e., grade level, study duration, culture, learning strategy, and assessment tool) that might influence the effects of robot-supported CT cultivation. Moderator analyses indicated that short-term (less than four weeks) robot-supported learning had a larger effect (g = 0.901) on CT practice than long-term (more than eleven weeks) learning (g = 0.309). This meta-analysis indicates that educators could apply robot-supported learning to cultivate students' CT and concludes with related implications.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has gained increasing recognition as a 21st-century competency. Although initiatives have been taken to define the term for educational practices, limited empirical evidence is available to clarify its underlying components, especially at the primary education level. This study aimed to identify the associations between CT and specific cognitive skills in the primary school context. Based on the literature, three cognitive domains were studied (i.e., mathematical, visuospatial, and reasoning skills) and standard test batteries were applied to a sample of 633 primary students (aged 7–12 years). Linear regression analyses were performed with CT performance as the dependent variable to investigate its associations with the measured cognitive skills, and demographic features (i.e., age, gender) and coding learning experience (i.e., years of coding experience, extra-curricular coding experience) were included as control variables. The results indicated that the students’ CT performance was significantly predicted by their attainments in numeracy, visual perception, spatial visualisation, and inductive reasoning, and the results remained significant after controlling for demographics and coding experience. The study adds to the literature by enriching the understanding of CT as a psychological construct and has practical implications for educational stakeholders regarding the importance of interdisciplinary teaching and the integration of specific cognitive skills into CT learning activities.

AB  - The sustainable and digital future of work may imply a dramatic equilibrium change between social factors and technological ones. We argue that providing suitable tools to support End-User Development (EUD) in the workplace could represent a way to cope with such future changes. The contributions of this paper include the analysis and characterization of the most used EUD techniques and their crossover with a new conveyed model of Computational Thinking. The synthesis between these aspects is made explicit in the construct of EUDability, which is designed to capture the quality dimensions of EUD systems suitable to work scenarios where better roles and better tools for individuals may be shaped. EUDability has to do with identifying and assessing the difficulties of EUD techniques on one side and the Computational Thinking skills held by individuals on the other side.

AB  - There has been an increasing interest in the integration of technology into language education. Meanwhile, computational thinking (CT) skills are fostered which influence communicative language teaching and learning. Despite CT's established importance in science education, its significance in language teaching remains scarce. This study contributes to knowledge synthesis and methodological development by reviewing 16 journal articles, analyzing CT applications in language learning across educational contexts, intervention tools, CT skills, language acquisition, and assessment methods. The results indicate that (a) more CT-involved activities are needed for primary, secondary, and tertiary education, (b) educational robots and Scratch stand out as the most trending intervention tools, (c) CT skills such as decomposition, abstraction, generalization and so on have a positive effect on students’ foreign language acquisition, especially in grammar and writing, (d) assessment of CT development can be surveyed through a validated and reliable instrument such as computer programming self-efficacy scale or an online platform: Dr. Scratch; Conversely, there is a diversity of evaluation tools in foreign language learning. This study is the first to review experimental research on integrating computational thinking into foreign language learning and offers significant implications for future research.

AB  - The development of programming skills and computational thinking in the formal educational context is one of the most recent horizons set by many educational systems worldwide. Although the first computational thinking initiatives are being applied from the earliest school ages, this research focuses on the secondary education level. Specifically, the objective is the following: to analyse the implementation of Arduino, as well as the benefits and opportunities it brings to secondary school students. For this purpose, documentary research has been undertaken applying a systematic review according to the PRISMA 2020 framework following the PiCoS strategy. Atlas.ti 9 was used to analyse the information. Out of 316 papers identified, 37 were included in the research. In relation to the results, Arduino is primarily used in technology and physics subjects, although it is also used to develop interdisciplinary STEAM projects. As a rule, it is used to learn programming languages, but likewise as a resource to develop science experiments. LED lights, servomotors and breadboards are among the most commonly used resources together with the Arduino board. and Scratch was the most widely used software. The initiatives implemented have yielded both positive and negative results, for example, one drawback is that some projects are very difficult, and some achievements such as: increased motivation towards the contents addressed or also the development of some soft skills, such as problem solving.

AB  - Recently, virtual reality (VR) technology has shown great potential in advancing education with many pedagogical benefits for building the 21st-century teaching and learning experience. This study conducted a formative evaluation of an immersive VR expedition application with the aim of understanding users' learning processes and how the application facilitates higher education students' computational thinking skills. Six participants were randomly selected to conduct this evaluation. A mixed research approach consisting of quantitative and qualitative methods was employed. The study quantitatively analyzed users' scores from gameplay to understand how the intervention supported computational thinking skills. Participants were also interviewed to collect data after playing the mini-games to investigate users' experiences. The study showcases players' computational thinking competency, assessed automatically during gameplay. Further, this study used inductive content analysis to demonstrate users' reactions to prototyped VR mini-games. The qualitative findings suggest that users found the VR mini-games interactive and immersive, which provided an opportunity to foster learners' computational thinking skills. The quantitative analysis revealed that student's computational thinking competency can be enhanced through consistent playing of the mini-games. Moreover, the expedition aspect of the VR game stimulated learners' curiosity, which sustained their learning progress. Furthermore, users gained new knowledge and found the mini-games educative. Nevertheless, several aspects of the VR mini-games need improvements, according to users' perceptions. This study contributes to the knowledge in terms of the affordances of VR in education research and provides relevant insights that can shape future studies, for example, the recent hype of metaverse in education.

AB  - Project-Based Learning (PBL) and Computational Thinking (CT), a teaching strategy and a problem-solving method, respectively, have been widely used in teaching and learning because of their educational advantages for students and teachers. However, studies of their integration into the teaching and learning process have been scarce, resulting in a lack of guidance for educators to implement such an approach that apply constructivism learning theory. This study aims to systematically review and identify appropriate frameworks, models, techniques and tools that could guide the successful implementation of PBL-CT. This study examined relevant articles published from 2017 to 2021 to highlight the gaps in the PBL-CT execution and map their backgrounds into a coherent taxonomy that could help guide the directions of future studies. As revealed, none of such articles explicitly explain any suitable PBL-CT frameworks or models. The study identified several common elements for the PBL-CT framework formulation, indicating scaffolding and inquiry are the most commonly applied techniques, with visual tools dominating the PBL-CT implementation. Most articles involved computing, followed by STEM, with a few originating from non-STEM fields. Several important implications could help educators develop an effective PBL-CT course design and provide some guidelines for future research. An effective PBL-CT integration enhances teaching and learning besides improving students' computational thinking skills. Thinking skills are critical 21st-century skills needed for students' success.

AB  - Computational thinking has become an integral component of curricula worldwide, necessitating teachers to develop this competence in their students. To effectively meet these curricular requirements, teachers themselves need a solid foundation of computational thinking content knowledge, which refers to the understanding and skills they possess in this area. However, despite widespread recognition of this need, few studies have rigorously examined teachers' content knowledge in this domain. Addressing this gap requires the development of high-quality measurement tools. This study details the development of an instrument, created as part of the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) 2023 in Flanders, to measure lower secondary school teachers' computational thinking content knowledge in a valid and reliable way. The article first outlines the construction process of the instrument, which involved close collaboration with experts in the field and drew upon the framework of Fraillon et al. (2023). Following this, the instrument's psychometric properties are presented, which include both item-level and overall instrument characteristics. These properties were evaluated using data from a sample of 352 participants, applying both Classical Test Theory and Item Response Theory. The final tool consists of sixteen multiple-choice and short constructed response questions. The results indicate favorable item and overall instrument characteristics, thereby affirming its potential to measure the intended construct in a valid and accurate way.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) skills help students both understand and utilize computing in various domains to cope with the challenges posed by the complex digital world. This study applied mind mapping to programming language instruction in a primary school, and explored the effects of mind mapping on students' CT skills when learning programming with Scratch as a programming tool. Two types of mind mapping, construct-by-self mind mapping (CBS-MM) and construct-on-scaffold mind mapping (COS-MM), were proposed to compare which type is more effective in terms of students' CT skills. Seventy-three public primary school fifth-grade students aged 10 to 11 participated in the study. The CBS group included 33 students learning with the CBS-MM instructional approach, while the COS group comprised 40 students learning with the COS-MM instructional approach. Data were obtained from nine topic Scratch programming assignments and pre- and post-CT skills surveys completed by the two groups. Paired sample t tests were used to analyze whether the two types of mind mapping approach could improve both groups' CT skills. One-way ANCOVA and one-way ANOVA were used to examine the difference in the two groups' CT skills. The results showed that both CBS-MM and COS-MM can improve students' CT skills; however, the COS group students could better improve their CT skills with the assistance of the COS-MM method compared with the CBS group students who learned with the CBS-MM method. The findings of this study can provide some enlightenment for relevant instructors to design instruction and implement programming teaching with different kinds of mind mapping support that facilitates students’ CT.

AB  - The specific mechanisms by which teachers and parents can provide culturally relevant opportunities for computational thinking for racially/ethnically and linguistically diverse groups of preschoolers remain unknown. Accordingly, the purpose of this research is to examine how PreK parent and teacher voice directed efforts to realize a culturally relevant computing program. We drew data sources from a subsample of design-based research meetings in which partners collaborated to co-develop the first iteration of the program. Using qualitative analysis, we examined how parent voice and teacher voice, conceptualized as perspectives and participation, influenced theories of culturally responsive computing and computational thinking in early childhood education and the translation of theory into practice in classroom and home settings. Findings showed that connecting powerful ideas from computational thinking, namely algorithms and problem solving (e.g., debugging), to familiar activities and experiences served as a powerful entry point. Yet, differences arose in how teachers and parents conceptualized culturally relevant computing and made connections to familiar routines. We discuss what can be learned from parent voice in regards to bolstering children's self-expression, access to increasingly complex computational thinking tasks, and opportunities for learning cultural and community values through computing.

AB  - In recent years, the development of computational thinking (CT) has become integral to many school curricula worldwide. This has been associated with calls for computational thinking to be considered a ‘21St Century’ competency, valuable to all students as a transferable process for solving problems and building understanding of human behaviour and systems. However, while computational thinking is a focus of most secondary school computer science curricula, proponents such as Jeanette Wing argue its relevance for younger students, indicating more work must be done investigating its development in early years' education. This study used a structured, problem-based curriculum supported by guided inquiry pedagogy, to explore 6 year old students' learning of basic computational thinking concepts and practices while coding programmable floor robots (Blue-bots and an iPad app). Results indicated improvement across the seven lessons in students' sequencing/algorithm authoring, error correction, and pattern recognition. Furthermore, they revealed evidence of higher order thinking such as identifying patterns in code, and how these can be transferred to help solve problems of different designs. While currently play-based approaches are used to introduce computational thinking concepts and practices in early years' education, results from this study suggest that more structured, problem-based methods should be seriously considered. Results challenge commonly understood developmental theories about what young children can and can't do, contextualised within the field of computer science, and hold implications for early years' teachers' professional knowledge and pedagogy if they are to promote their students' learning in this increasingly important area. Given rapid technological advancements such as artificial intelligence (AI) and increasingly earlier exposure of young children to digitally-mediated information, this study provides support for the earlier and more systematic introduction of basic digital literacy knowledge and skills in early years' education.

AB  - We conducted a systematic review of empirical studies aimed at exploring robot-mediated activities to promote the development of computational thinking in preschoolers. In this study, we investigated the robots used, proposed activities, and evaluation processes. We also analyzed research contexts and the stated motivations to conduct the studies. Our review identified characteristics of the robots, such as input and output interfaces, cost, and availability. We also categorized activities considering context, modality of work, type of activities, duration, adults’ role, scaffolding, unplugged activities, explicit debugging, communication and sharing instances, and teaching knowledge from other domains. We analyzed the computational thinking evaluation process looking at types of assessments, asset concepts, and research design. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of existing research, identifies existing gaps, and provides recommendations for future studies.

AB  - The integration of computational thinking (CT) into K-12 education offers substantial potential to improve digital literacy and deepen students’ understanding across various subject areas. By embedding computational procedures and solution-oriented approaches into traditional curricula, students can develop essential skills that are critical for thriving in an increasingly digital world. However, the effective integration of CT into subject-specific learning poses challenges for educators, largely due to a lack of training and experience in implementing interdisciplinary instructional strategies. This study explores the impact of integrating CT into K-12 education through diverse instructional approaches, including modelling, storytelling, and unplugged activities. The research examines how students' subject knowledge, CT concepts, and practices evolved under each CT integration practice, as well as their acceptance toward CT integrated lessons. The study was conducted in different subjects, including language arts, biology, and physics, and at different grade levels. The technology acceptance model was used as a theoretical framework to understand students' adoption towards the different integration practices. The study revealed that different CT integration practices yield varying impacts on students' attitudes, particularly in relation to their prior programming experiences. Namely, primary school students with prior programming experience display a higher behavioural intention due to a lack of early biases toward programming. Conversely, secondary school students, less familiar with interdisciplinary approaches, initially show less enthusiasm for future engagement. These insights underscore the need for tailored instructional strategies that consider students' prior experiences and the broader goal of preparing them to contribute to a technologically driven society.

AB  - As we begin to identify essential skills for the future, there has been an increased focus on how to define and implement computational thinking within education. However, the question of how to engage children with coding activities within the context and limitations of the curriculum remains relatively explored. In our study, a human-centered design approach was followed to guide a small group of children through the co-design, implementation and evaluation of a board game. The board game had two versions: an offline version involving a robotic agent and an online version with its digital equivalent. A mixed-method approach was used to understand and compare levels of engagement, usability, and collaboration in both versions of the game. The tangible aspect of working with a robotic agent in the offline version led to greater levels of motivation and involvement with the game mechanics. Tangible robotics games tend to be more approachable for children. Our study shows that using such games by connecting the mathematics curriculum with coding problems can successfully engage participants in collaborative computational thinking activities. We contribute to the field by providing human-centered guidance for the creation of educational tools to develop computational thinking. Such guidance is not only applicable in technologically rich environments; it can also be applied in educational communities with limited access to technology.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has been relevant in teaching STEM courses, and educators are incorporating both plugged and unplugged CT activities in their modules to prepare new entrants for advanced knowledge. However, additional empirical data are needed to understand how an unplugged activities approach can lead to an improved understanding of CT concepts. Therefore, this study investigates the impact of unplugged activities on novice students' CT skills and unravels the characteristics of students' CT competency from performing unplugged activities. The experimental aspect of this study was conducted with a cohort of 210 students participating in an introductory programming course at a University in Nigeria. A mixed-method research approach and a quasi-experimental design were applied in this study to understand how the unplugged approach in teaching CT could help students improve their CT competency. A paired-sample t-test of familiarity score for each CT concept showed a significant increase in the score before and after the intervention. Furthermore, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was used for topic modeling of the text describing students’ solutions. Topic modeling allows for more insights into the steps taken by the students to solve CT problems. Only 27.62 % of students' solution descriptions contained CT concepts, 56.90 % of the students solved the puzzle with an optimal score, and 72.41 % of students who applied CT concepts of problem abstraction and decomposition were able to solve the puzzle correctly. Indeed, CT unplugged activities significantly increased the number of students who gained CT competency. In addition, this study provides recommendation for computer science educators and highlight future direction.

AB  - Computational thinking is a fundamental competence that is being introduced in K-12 and succeeding curricula worldwide. Despite this huge effort, many computational thinking models in the literature do not explicitly take into consideration the pupils’ age and the developmental nature of computational thinking skills. Furthermore, many existing computational thinking models are focused on the internal thinking processes of the individuals, failing to explicitly consider the situated nature, in terms of social context and artefactual environment, that usually characterise tasks that require computational thinking to be solved. In this paper, we present a framework for the design, realisation, analysis, and assessment of computational thinking activities, called CT-cube. The CT-cube allows to extend existing computational thinking models to consider the life-long development of computational thinking skills in individuals, from childhood to adult age, and to take into consideration the situated nature of computational thinking activities. We use the CT-cube to design an unplugged task, called Cross Array Task (CAT), allowing to assess the algorithmic skills of K-12 pupils and we show how the CT-cube can be used in this case to illustrate the development of this competence along the entire compulsory school path, considering a sample of 109 pupil aged 3 to 16 in Switzerland.

AB  - The current single teaching and assessing modes of English as a foreign language (EFL) grammar in China have caused the disconnect between grammar knowledge and competency with numerous errors in essay writing, somehow ignoring the analysis of learners thinking patterns. To solve the problem, computational thinking (CT), a higher-order thinking in solving problems and optimizing the way to acquire knowledge, was employed in the study. As needed, the experimental group was taught using the CT teaching model following CT principal elements (data analysis, pattern recognition, abstraction, decomposition, and parallelization), while the control group followed the traditional teaching mode. Quantitative and qualitative data were obtained based on the pre-test-post-test, classroom observation, and questionnaire survey. The results show that the grammar application in short essay writing of all the members of the experimental group significantly improved and that higher grammar learning agency and engagement were unfolded to show the changes of thinking patterns. However, not all the members from the control group showed similar results. CT serves as an important social mediation tool in EFL teaching. This study further enriches the teaching modes of grammar and is an effective attempt at introducing CT into learners’ thinking patterns.

AB  - With growing interest in supporting the development of computational thinking (CT) in early childhood, there is also need for new assessments that serve multiple purposes and uses. In particular, there is a need to understand the design of formative assessments that can be used during classroom instruction to provide feedback to teachers and children in real-time. In this paper, we report on an empirical study and advance a new unit of observational analysis for formative assessment that we call an indicator of a knowledge refinement opportunity or as a shorthand, KRO indicators. We put forth a new framework for conceptualizing the design of formative assessments that builds on the Evidence Centered Design framework but centers identification and analysis of indicators of knowledge refinement opportunities. We illustrate a number of key indicators through empirical examples drawn from video recordings of Kindergarten classroom lessons.

AB  - Interest in coding education has exploded in the past five years, especially in elementary and early secondary education. Teachers who are largely new to coding are expected to guide entire student bodies through the fundamentals of coding and computational thinking. But little is known about which coding and computational thinking (CT) concepts teachers feel most comfortable with and which concepts they struggle with. This study describes 127 elementary coding teachers’ changes in their beliefs about teaching coding and CT as they participated in year-long continuous professional development. Novice elementary coding teachers demonstrated most growth in their self-efficacy for teaching sequences, algorithms and loops. They were less secure in their knowledge of conditionals, variables, and functions. For computational thinking, teachers were most confident in their ability to identify patterns, think algorithmically, understand logic, and evaluate outcomes, showing less growth with decomposition and abstraction.

AB  - This study compares the effects of coding education with educational robot and unplugged coding activities on pre-school students' computational thinking and executive function skills. This study used a pre-test and post-test comparison group quasi-experimental design. The study was conducted in a public kindergarten with 48 pre-school students (24 educational robot- BeeBot® group and 24-unplugged coding group) aged 5-6. The TechCheck-K test was used to measure computational thinking skills, and Executive Functions Battery-Computerized Touch was used to measure executive function skills. The process started with pre-test applications and ended with post-tests after four weeks (16 different sessions) of the implementation in both groups. The study found a statistically significant difference between the computational thinking pre-test and post-test scores of pre-school students in both groups in favor of the post-test. It was determined that there was a statistically significant difference in favor of the educational robot group between the post-test scores of computational thinking skills. In addition, when the findings regarding executive functions were evaluated, there was a statistically significant difference between the pre-test and post-test scores of total executive function in favor of the post-test in both groups. However, it was observed that there was no statistically significant difference between the post-test scores of both groups in terms of total executive function skills scores. In addition, when the post-test scores of pre-school students in two groups were evaluated, it was determined that there was no significant difference in computational thinking and executive function skills according to gender. Consequently, it was determined that coding education with an educational robot was more effective for gaining computational thinking skills than unplugged coding activities for pre-school students. However, it was observed that there was no difference between the two groups in terms of the development of executive function skills in pre-school education.

AB  - Since environmental and energy issues and challenges continues to emerge as key global concerns, Green Building Certification Systems are becoming increasingly relevant in the construction industry. In this regard, LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is considered one of the most widely recognized environmental assessment methods used globally in the construction industry today. However, due to the high level of complexity of the LEED system, the tools usually used to verify the achievement of the credits lack of “design friendliness” and hardly communicate effectively with the conventional tools used by architects and engineers (e.g. CAD, BIM). This makes difficult to fully take into account, especially at the early design stage, the many interconnected aspects that contribute to the green certification, with consequent issues often arising in the design validation and/or construction phases, resulting in time delays and cost increments. The application of innovative problem-solving methods, such as computational thinking, together with coding techniques, represents an effective way to deal with this issue. This kind of methodology, in fact, allows the requirements of a specific LEED credit to be digitally parametrised and flexibly incorporated into a “designer friendly” working environment. In particular, Visual Programming Languages (VPLs), due to their high simplicity of usage, allow architects and engineers to develop algorithms and thus implement their technical knowledge in the field of environmental design with computer programming skills, useful to improve their tools and keep them constantly updated. The aim of this paper is to illustrate a methodology through which, by merging computational thinking strategies with VPL tools, is possible to keep under control, in the same working environment, all the parameters required to verify in real time the achievement of LEED credits. To demonstrate the flexibility of the approach, dedicated tools developed for the verification of some specific credits at different scales – neighbourhood and building – are illustrated as operational examples of the proposed methodology.

AB  - Computational thinking, defined by Wing (2011) as the “thought processes involved in formulating problems … so that the solutions are represented in a form that can effectively be carried out by an information-processing agent,” has become the central construct of K12 computing education around the world. This article provides a history of computational thinking, a summary of computational thinking's role in educational policy and practice, role as a research construct, and concludes by considering the future of computational thinking. The debate over how to define and teach computational thinking can be understood as a proxy for the broader questions about education.

AB  - Collecting and organizing data to understand and answer real-world questions is an increasingly important skill in our current world. Fostering data collection and analysis (DCA) skills in young children leverages key mathematics skills as well as the data representation, visualization, and interpretation skills of computational thinking (CT), culminating in a problem-solving approach with data. As such, the intervention, comprising investigations and a digital app, supported preschool teachers and children to answer data-focused questions by engaging in each step of the DCA process in order to foster CT and math skills. Teachers appreciated that the app offers a new way for children to visualize data and noted that the app provided learning opportunities for children that would not otherwise be possible or easy to implement. Results also suggest that the app provides a systematic process for data collection, entry, and interpretation. Children in classrooms that completed the intervention had significantly higher scores at post-intervention compared to children in classrooms that did not complete the intervention, controlling for pre-intervention scores, B(SE) = 0.13(0.05), t (6) = 2.48, p = .048.

AB  - Computational Thinking (CT), the conceptual foundations required for solving complex problems effectively and efficiently, is an imperative skill for today's learners, across disciplines and across ages. As for its importance in the wide network of digital literacies, CT has been implemented in various educational contexts, however mostly via digital artifacts, specifically in programming-related activities. This approach does not fulfill the potential of such integration for promoting learning. In this paper, we argue that digital literacies should not be bound to the digital realm, and present a novel approach to fully integrate CT into learning and teaching by the development of CT-infused “unplugged” pedagogical tools that are fully embedded in the subject matter. We demonstrate the advantages to student learning of these tools in two case studies from K-12 mathematics education: 1) An assistive tool for function investigation in high-school calculus – in this case, we point out to how CT skills that were implemented in the tool promoted students' problem solving; 2) A teaching unit for pattern sequences in elementary school – in this case, we show how students in the CT research group outperformed students in the other groups, and how they implemented CT to solve pattern sequence problems effectively and efficiently. We highlight that besides enhancing learning, this approach can help address the important issue of equity in education, and suggest ways to promote it via dedicated professional development.

AB  - Creativity and Computational Thinking (CT) have been pointed out as two important skills that would promote students in the digital age as contributing members of society. Therefore, these two constructs have been extensively researched in recent years, but the associations between them are yet to be fully understood. This study takes another step towards bridging this gap by examining the association between CT and three types of creativity, i.e., Figural Creative Thinking, Verbal Creative Thinking, and Computational Creativity. Data was collected from 119 ninth-grade students (14–15 years old) from Israel. Students took two commonly used creativity tests (Torrance's Test of Creative Thinking, and the Alternative Uses Test). They also used Kodetu—an online learning environment for CT—and we used the system log files to measure their CT acquirement and their computational creativity. Findings suggest some nuanced associations between the four sets of variables. Specifically, we point out the limited associations between verbal and figural creativities, some of which are negative; also, we found that the associations between creative thinking and CT, as well as between creative thinking and computational creativity, differ by gender.

AB  - Many studies have demonstrated that Virtual Exchange (VE) for teaching languages can have a positive effect on learners' intercultural awareness or achievements. However, during this century, the teaching process has shifted from teaching with technology to solving problems with it. In this regard, pedagogical experts in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) have developed programming and robotics based on Computational Thinking skills (CTs), which have been regarded as the core of 21st-century skills. In the field of CALL, this skill has received very little attention. Accordingly, we have attempted to switch the process and outcome of language learning in VE. Thus, we developed the conceptual framework that integrated CTsCALL and Individual-technology-task-environment Fit (ITTEF). Having designed our VE tasks based on CTsCALL, we provided the opportunity for 92 Spanish language learners in our project to exchange language and culture with Cypriot and Irish students and solve VE tasks based on CTsCALL. The result of the symmetric phase of the study validated the five-dimensional structure of CTsCALL and the four-dimensional structures of ITTEF in VE and CALL. It also revealed that language learners, who focused on the key information rather than the details while solving language tasks, as well as recognizing the pattern of task solving and applying them to other tasks, found VE, and CTsCALL to be aligned with their current capabilities, learning environment, and problem-solving skills that mediated their intention to learn and exchange information in this context in the future. Furthermore, the asymmetrical part of the study revealed that sixteen solutions are available to shape language learners' continued intention to use VE by combining the components of CTsCALL and ITTEF. Thus, the study developed the CTsCALL questionnaire and its theory into CALL together with the Council of Europe's Common European Framework of Reference for Languages and recommended that CALL researchers and educators take a broader view of VE, as well as continuing to validate CTsCALL in other CALL disciplines to show that this skill belongs to CALL as well.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is gaining increasing attention from researchers and practitioners all over the world to empower children in the digital era. However, there is no consensus on which components of CT to teach beginning coders in early childhood education (ECE). To address this issue, we conducted a systematic review of 42 empirical studies focused on teaching and assessing CT in ECE. We analyzed the included studies with the three-dimensional CT framework proposed by Brennan and Resnick (2012) and demonstrated how this framework could be modified to fit the context of ECE. Based on this systematic review, we sorted out the CT components that were proven suitable for young children to learn by incorporating emerging components and removing components inappropriate for young children. We thus proposed a CT curriculum framework for ECE that covers CT concepts (i.e., control flow/structures, representation, and hardware/software), CT practices (i.e., algorithmic design, pattern recognition, abstraction, debugging, decomposition, iteration, and generalizing), and CT perspectives (i.e., expressing and creating, connecting, perseverance, and choices of conduct). This systematic review and its associated CT curriculum framework provide important theoretical contributions and practical implications for early childhood CT education.

AB  - In this paper, we review and meta-analyze the findings of experimental studies published between 2006 and 2022 that examined the effects of coding and programming interventions on children's core and higher order executive functions (response inhibition, working memory, cognitive flexibility, planning and problem solving). The systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to address three research questions: 1) Which executive functions are most impacted by the teaching of CT? 2) Which instructional modality (educational robotics/virtual coding/unplugged coding) is most effective in enhancing executive function skills in learners aged 4–16 years? and 3) Does the cognitive effectiveness of coding vary with children's age? A total of 19 studies with 1523 participants met the selection criteria for the systematic review. The meta-analysis included 11 of those studies. The results reveal beneficial effects of structured virtual and tangible coding (educational robotics) activities for preschoolers and first graders, and significant effects of more unstructured virtual coding activities (e.g., Scratch-based) for older students. A multivariate fixed-effects model meta-analysis shows that the teaching of coding significantly improves problem-solving with the highest effect (dppc2 = 0.89), but also planning (dppc2 = 0.36), and inhibition and working memory with lower effects (dppc2 = 0.17, dppc2 = 0.20).

AB  - In light of the increasing importance digital economy, the significance of computational thinking has grown exponentially, becoming imperative in both workplace and academic settings such as universities. This article addresses the critical need to comprehend the factors influencing the acceptance of computational thinking. The dataset introduces an extensive questionnaire comprising five constructs and 25 items, rooted in the extended Technology Acceptance Model. Notably, the model incorporates facilitating conditions and subjective norm, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding acceptance. Data collection involved 132 undergraduate university students sampled through purposive sampling, specifically targeting courses with a focus on computational thinking. The resulting dataset serves as a valuable resource for future research, offering detailed insights into the factors determining the acceptance of technology in educational contexts beyond mere thinking skills. Given the scarcity of research on technology acceptance in developing nations, this dataset holds particular significance, serving as a foundation for potential cross-cultural comparisons. The dataset contributes to the field by presenting a robust acceptance model, explaining 74.2 per cent of the variance in behavioural intention, 60.2 per cent in perceived usefulness, and 56.1 per cent in perceived ease of use. This high explanatory power positions the dataset as a superior resource for replication, benchmarking, and broader applicability in diverse contexts, thereby enhancing the understanding of computational thinking acceptance across different populations and settings. This dataset stands among the pioneering efforts to assess the novel covariance-based structural equation model algorithm within SmartPLS 4, presenting a valuable resource for future research employing the same mechanism.

AB  - This paper describes a study designed to investigate the promise of resources that support the development of computational thinking (CT) in preschool children. This study was the culmination of a collaborative research process between researchers and media developers of a home-based intervention that included media and hands-on activities created to support the development of young children's CT. The mixed-methods study included 108 families, each with a 4- or 5-year-old child. Families, who participated in the study at home for six weeks, were randomly assigned to an intervention group that viewed media and engaged with hands-on activities with a CT focus or a control group that viewed and engaged with non-STEM literacy content. Data collection consisted of parent surveys, parent interviews, and CT learning and pre-coding tasks to assess children's CT abilities. Results indicate that the learning intervention demonstrates promise in supporting parental understanding of CT. Experience with the intervention over the six weeks also appeared to cultivate some CT strategy use in children as evidenced by parental reports and performance on learning and pre-coding sequencing tasks.

AB  - This study characterizes the literature on teaching computational thinking (CT) to preschoolers aged 4 to 5 years. Previous research and published systematic studies have provided important contributions about CT teaching to elementary and high school children. However, to date, there is no systematic overview of CT education for preschoolers. For this reason, this systematic mapping synthesizes 82 studies on CT teaching, through the implementation and evaluation of tools and activities to teach, improve or measure the CT knowledge acquired by children. Furthermore, studies on courses or training offered to preschool teachers related to the teaching of CT were also considered. From the selected studies, the following information was collected: year of publication; recovery sources and databases; vehicles and places of publication; temporal delimitation of research, research approach, nature and research method; CT teaching approaches; tools used to teach CT and how they are classified according to their physical characteristics and, finally, participants and individuals responsible for the research. The results suggest an increase in the number of publications in recent years, revealing the interest of researchers in the topic. Furthermore, we observed a trend towards the use of physical artifacts and the use of the disconnected computing approach to teaching CT skills to preschool children. The results also exposed that preschool teachers have little autonomy in implementing CT teaching activities because those are mostly implemented by computer professionals (researchers, teachers, etc.). This is because preschool teachers are still discouraged from teaching computer and technology-related content to children, considering them complex and disconnected from basic curricula. However, when teachers are trained to teach CT, they become interested in the content and become more active during the teaching process. We argue for integrating CT-related content into education curricula and supporting preschool teachers to implement it autonomously in their classrooms.

AB  - This paper deals within a context where technology plays a pivotal role in education. In this sense, it is essential to highlight the emergence of new competencies and skills in education due to technological advancements. Legislative frameworks have been developed to incorporate digital literacy, access to robotics, and computational thinking, between others. Hence, this review and meta-analysis aim at identifying the influence of robotics activities on computational thinking through a PRISMA-guided review. The findings reveal that interventions conducted in early childhood education significantly impact computational thinking. Results also showcase that, despite perceived barriers related to technology accessibility, the presence of legislation and contexts prioritizing these competencies is more relevant than the digital access gap.

AB  - Since computational thinking is a high-level cognitive skill and its conceptual framework has not yet been clarified, the assessment of this skill is problematic. While there is no consensus in the literature about the components of computational thinking, the abstraction component is located at a point where opinions intersect. In addition, it is predicted that computer science unplugged activities will improve computational thinking, and there is limited research examining this effect. As a result, this research aims to demonstrate the alleged effects of computer science unplugged activities on abstraction skill which is considered the critical component of computational thinking. The study, which was planned with a mixed methods research design, lasted 8 weeks. Quantitative data were obtained from the abstraction skill test developed by the researchers, while qualitative data were obtained from observations and task- based interviews after each activity. Quantitative findings showed that computer science unplugged activities significantly improve abstraction skills and thus computational thinking. Qualitative findings not only revealed that developments in the six abstracting steps caused this significant difference but also identified abstracting steps where the effect of each activity was limited. Suggestions for organizing activities to improve these steps are given. Finally, suggestions are presented for the conceptual framework of computational thinking based on abstraction.

AB  - The healthy development of cognitive functions, including executive functions, has been shown to depend mainly on the experiences and learning opportunities of people, especially during childhood. Over the past few years, researchers have been studying the impacts of diverse types of interventions on children’s cognitive development in which computational thinking programs are a recent field. This pilot study evaluated the effect of computational thinking training based on the “Programming for Children” program on the executive functions of children aged 10 and 11 years: working memory, inhibition, and planning (N = 30). The results showed that children in the experimental group improved on tests of visuospatial working memory, cognitive inhibition, and sequential planning compared with the control group. However, tests of verbal working memory, memory strategy, and visual spatial planning did not show any observed changes. Although this was an exploratory study, and its findings should be interpreted cautiously due to the small sample size, the findings support the relevance and feasibility of conducting similar larger studies with larger samples.

AB  - Computational thinking has been promoted as an impactful 21st-century skillset that can be transferred to many other disciplines and problem scenarios. With the proliferation of age-appropriate coding platforms for young children, computational thinking has become increasingly popular in early childhood settings. However, there is a lack of research on introducing coding and computational thinking to teacher training in early childhood education. To empower early childhood teachers in the digital society, this study introduced 17 early childhood teachers to robot programming and computational thinking through the ‘CT4ECE’ professional development program, which includes three phases: Learn, Practice, and Reflect & Improve. Results of pre- and post-intervention surveys revealed that the CT4ECE program significantly enhanced teachers' robotics and pedagogical knowledge, as well as their attitudes towards computational thinking, especially their interest in and their view of using computational thinking in classroom practice. Post-intervention interviews indicated that participation in CT4ECE helped educators gain a basic understanding of both coding robots and computational thinking suitable for young children due to a structured change process for teachers' professional learning. This study establishes a strong foundation for enhancing and expanding the CT4ECE program, ultimately equipping teachers and children with the necessary skillsets to thrive in the digital future.

AB  - The purpose of the current study is to investigate the effects of the unplugged computational thinking (CT) integrated STEM (UCT-STEM) approach and STEM approach on early childhood pre-service teachers’ CT skills (creativity, algorithmic thinking, critical thinking, problem solving, cooperativity, communication). The study was conducted with a total of 70 early childhood pre-service teachers. Quasi-experimental design was used; activities based on the UCT-STEM approach were administered to the experimental group and activities based on the STEM approach were administered to the control group. Post-test scores for CT skills showed a statistically significant difference in favour of the experimental group. It was concluded that the UCT-STEM approach was more effective in developing the pre-service teachers’ CT skills than the STEM approach. The current study presents an important finding to the literature in terms of the developed STEM and UCT-STEM contents and how these contents improve pre-service teachers’ CT skills. The STEM and UCT-STEM content provides significant information in terms of teacher practices. At the same time, this study offers important implications for program developers and policy-makers to integrate these innovative educational approaches into both early childhood education and teacher education programs.

AB  - The integration of computational thinking (CT) to enhance creativity in design students has often been underexplored in design education. While design thinking has traditionally been the cornerstone of university design pedagogy and remains essential, the increasing role of digital tools and artificial intelligence in modern design practices presents new opportunities for innovation. By introducing CT alongside design thinking, students can expand their creative toolkit and engage with emerging technologies more effectively. Although many design students may have limited experience with programming, incorporating accessible, no-code tools can help them confidently embrace computational methods, unlocking new pathways for creative exploration and innovation. This study proposes an alternative approach to improve the motivation of design students by introducing machine learning tools into product design processes. We developed an experimental pedagogy in which 56 industrial design university students learned how to use Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (Weka), a machine learning tool, for three hours of design work a week, for a total of eight weeks. Our covariate analysis of data collected in the pretest and posttest shows that the general learning motivations in the group using Weka are significantly higher than those in the group without Weka. However, no significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of learning strategies, collaboration, or critical thinking. Students using Weka spent more time focusing on model training and tended to improve their algorithmic thinking, and the introduction of Weka appeared to enhance their motivation to learn. On the other hand, these students might have been focusing on working individually at their computers, potentially neglecting communication and collaboration. The findings suggest that teaching machine learning applications without requiring coding has the potential to boost design students' motivation to engage with CT skills, though care must be taken to maintain collaborative practices.

AB  - There is increasing effort to integrate Computational Thinking (CT) curricula across all education levels. Therefore, research on CT assessment has lately progressed towards developing and validating reliable CT assessment tools, which are crucial for evaluating students' potential learning progress and thus the effectiveness of suggested curricular programs. Several CT assessment tools were developed for elementary, high-school, and university students over the last years. Moreover, associations between CT scores and other cognitive abilities were unraveled. However, studies on the topic in primary school level are scarce. Like the general concept of intelligence, CT remains broadly defined as the ability to combine algorithmic operations to form complex solutions in order to solve problems effectively, utilizing concepts of computer science with or without the use of computers. In this study, we aimed at specifying a cognitive definition of CT, focusing on the under-investigated population of primary school children. Since validated assessment tools for this age group were not available, we adapted a validated CT test, which was initially designed for middle school students. In our study participated 192 third and fourth graders. The analyses revealed promising results on the reliability of the adapted CT assessment for primary school students. Moreover, findings indicated CT's positive associations with i. complex numerical abilities, ii. verbal reasoning abilities, and iii. non-verbal visuospatial abilities. Our results indicate similarities but also differences in associations of CT with other cognitive abilities in primary school children compared to other age groups. In summary: i. numerical abilities seem to associate with CT at the primary school level, whereas this seems not the case later on in education, ii. verbal abilities seem to associate with CT both along primary and secondary education levels, and iii. non-verbal reasoning abilities seem to associate with CT from primary education level to the university level and beyond. These differences imply that several basic cognitive abilities support CT abilities and CT development differentially across ages.

AB  - The concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI), born as the possibility of simulating the human brain's learning capabilities, quickly evolves into one of the educational technology concepts that provide tools for students to better themselves in a plethora of areas. Unlike the previous educational technology iterations, which are limited to instrumental use for providing platforms to build learning applications, AI has proposed a unique education laboratory by enabling students to explore an instrument that functions as a dynamic system of computational concepts. However, the extent of the implications of AI adaptation in modern education is yet to be explored. Motivated to fill the literature gap and to consider the emerging significance of AI in education, this paper aims to analyze the possible intertwined relationship between students’ intrinsic motivation for learning Artificial Intelligence during the COVID-19 pandemic; the relationship between students’ computational thinking and understanding of AI concepts; and the underlying dynamic relation, if existing, between AI and computational thinking building efforts. To investigate the mentioned relationships, the present empirical study employs mediation analysis based upon collected 137 survey data from Universidad Politécnica de Madrid students in the Institute for Educational Science and the School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering during the first quarter of 2022. Findings show that intrinsic motivation mediates the relationship between perceived Artificial Intelligence learning and computational thinking. Also, the research indicates that intrinsic motivation has a significant relationship with computational thinking and perceived Artificial Intelligence learning.

AB  - Computational thinking is widely recognized as an essential skill for adapting to the current era, with programming learning being the most effective means to develop it. It is recommended that computational thinking and learning programming be introduced as early as elementary school. However, elementary school students often possess limited prior knowledge of programming, posing challenges in their learning process. The graphic organizers (GOs) may serve as a bridge between students’ existing knowledge and new learning, facilitating a deeper processing of the overall information and thereby enhancing the learning process. This can be particularly advantageous for early-stage learners when grappling with difficult subjects. Consequently, this study employed GOs to assist elementary school students in their computational thinking and programming learning, employing a quasi-experiment design to evaluate their effectiveness. The results showed that although all students demonstrated awareness of applying computational thinking to solve problems, those exposed to GO-based instruction exhibited higher levels of computational thinking, programming skills, and flow experiences.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) practices is a critical cognitive tool for students to overcome challenges in this technological era. Few studies investigated CT practices from a development perspective. A two-year intervention was implemented in 30 intervention and 22 control schools in Hong Kong to promote CT education (T1baseline: N = 13,056; T2: N = 16,367; and T3: N = 15,269). Senior primary students (grades 4 to 6) around 8–12 years old were targeted. Among them, 34% were girls at T1baseline. Their learning progression of cognitive development was assessed with a CT practices test. Data were analyzed using item response analysis. Learning trajectories of CT practices were modeled to understand how students’ cognitive development differed between schools. Insights of findings were discussed in bringing CT practices to life.

AB  - Engagement is critical to computational thinking and programming education. However, as multi-dimensional variables, when analyzing how different aspects of engagement in computational thinking tasks influence skills development, it becomes crucial to discern precisely which engagement components intersect with the progression of computational thinking skills. This discernment is pivotal because engagement can vary based on the task nature, the context, and the individual's preferences. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the gender differences in engagement and computational thinking skills and the predictive relationships among these sub-dimensions for boys and girls in an unplugged environment. In this study, a quasi-experiment for 90 sixth-grade students from a north Chinese primary school was performed. By partial least squares–structural equation modeling, students’ models of computational thinking skills and engagement were analyzed, and comparisons of boys and girls were made by analysis of covariance statistics. Results indicated that compared with boys, girls reported higher computational thinking performance and more engagement in unplugged contexts. Furthermore, girls’ computational thinking skills were only predicted by their cognitive engagement, whereas boys’ computational thinking skills were predicted by their behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement. Teachers can adopt these findings to design computational thinking teaching interventions that combine the advantages of unplugged activity and focus on the engagement of boys and girls.

AB  - In this work, we argue for expanding the scope of K-12 computational thinking (CT) integration contexts to include everyday scenarios involving moral reasoning. Epistemic overlap between computational thinking practices and moral reasoning suggest that these contexts are potentially rich sites to see “seeds of CT” in children's reasoning and can provide rich educational pathways for children into CT. Taking a case-study approach, we examine the reasoning of a second-grader, Ollie, on a task involving fair allocation of resources to victims of a natural disaster. Our analysis finds that Ollie's reasoning was rich with seeds of CT (e.g., problem formulation, abstraction, complex-systems thinking) and that empathy served as an important supporting role to the CT. This work has implications for curricular design, suggesting that fairness and resource allocation scenarios with built-in opportunities for empathy might provide rich sandboxes for CT integration.

AB  - Although there are different definitions for computational thinking in the literature, it is possible to define it mainly as problem solving, designing and interpreting new systems by thinking like a computer. According to Wing (2006), computational thinking is a way of designing a system and understanding human behaviors by focusing on the basic concepts of the computer sciences. The recent focus on computational thinking as a key 21 st century skill for all students has led to a number of curriculum initiatives to embed it in K-12 classrooms and to introduce computing ideas to students early during their schooling years. The present study aims to explore the effects of a short, intensive coding and robotics training on the computational thinking skill self-efficacy of middle school students. 24 fifth graders participated in the study and data were collected by means of the Computational Thinking Self-efficacy scale (CTS) and one open-ended question. Analyses of the pre, post and delayed tests revealed significant differences between the pre and post-tests.

AB  - Methodological innovations across social sciences are opening new avenues for conducting research designed to address real-world challenges. The benefits of utilizing the Design-Based Implementation Research (DBIR) approach in public libraries to resolve a persistent problem of practice, a lack of assessment tools to evaluate youth Computational Thinking (CT) programs, is demonstrated. Findings from a three-year, three-phased study utilizing the DBIR approach to design and implement a suite of assessment tools to assess CT programming in public libraries are presented. Guided by the four principles of the DBIR approach, this research produced new knowledge, including identifying CT program outcomes, challenges, and recommendations for designing and implementing assessment tools to measure the impact of public libraries' CT programming. Findings underscore the DBIR approach as a strategy for engaging with practitioners and helping shift their perspectives by resolving practice problems and facilitating the design of sustainable solutions.

AB  - Although there is controversy surrounding rewards and competition in education, they are key elements in digital game-based learning (DGBL). Research on the influence of rewards and competition in DGBL often yields mixed results, suggesting a need to investigate individual game elements and their interactions. This study implemented DGBL focusing on computational thinking (CT) in 7th-grade classes. Both quantitative and behavioral data were collected to understand the impact of rewards (power-up or customization) and competition (with or without) on students’ intrinsic motivation, game performance, behaviors, and CT skills. The findings uncovered significant interactions between rewards and competition. Students with both competition and power-up rewards achieved the highest game points but the lowest CT performance, whereas those exposed to the same power-up rewards without competition attained the lowest game points but the best CT performance. Implications are drawn for DGBL research and practice.

AB  - Despite growing interest in early childhood computational thinking (CT), there is a lack of validated assessments for children who are emerging readers. This paper presents validity and reliability evidence of a performance-based assessment of CT using item response theory (IRT) from 272 children aged 4–8. Using a two-parameter logistic model IRT model (2PL IRT), we confirmed that model- and item-level fits are acceptable. Item analyses revealed a high discriminability (M = 2.26, SD = 1.12) and a moderate item difficulty (M = −0.21; SD = 0.86), on average, across 19 items. Reliability analysis demonstrated that the assessment was substantially reliable (marginal reliability: rxx = 0.87). Differential item functioning (DIF) analyses indicated that the assessment estimated children's item parameters fairly, regardless of their gender and age. However, we confirmed gaps in latent ability (θ) of CT by gender and age: boys showed higher latent ability of CT than girls, and old children (above 72 months) showed higher latent ability than young children (below 72 months). Findings suggest the assessment is a fair measure that can serve as a reliable and valid tool to assess CT for children who are emerging readers.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is an important and essential skill for human beings to master in the 21st century. Although CT has received wide attention since this concept was proposed, the current theoretical models have not well defined the complex relations between CT and other cognitive abilities for young children. To provide insight into this gap, the current study proposed a model in which we hypothesized that CT was significantly related to arithmetic fluency that is viewed as an important domain of mathematics. Additionally, arithmetic fluency was predicted to mediate the relations of CT to other cognitive abilities, including reasoning and creativity. This study tested such direct and indirect relations in children aged 5–6 years. Consistent with previous studies on older age groups, the results showed that CT and arithmetic fluency were significantly related to each other and both were significantly related to reasoning ability and creative thinking as well. Moreover, this study, for the first time, indicated that arithmetic fluency totally mediated the relation between CT and reasoning ability, suggesting that these concepts share conceptual commonalities, such as the cognitive processes related to mathematics or/and abstraction; in contrast, arithmetic fluency did not mediate the relation between CT and creative thinking, suggesting that gaining CT skill may exert direct positive effect on the development of creativity. Therefore, despite the root in computer science, CT is associated with many cognitive and learning abilities in other domains, supporting the importance of including CT into early school education.

Learning games offer the potential for innovative, stealth assessments of students' implicit learning from gameplay behaviors. This paper reports on the measurement of implicit CT practices demonstrated by upper elementary- and middle-school students as they play the CT learning game Zoombinis. The process of using the gameplay log data to build valid automated detectors of students' implicit CT practices is discussed. Findings from this study provide implications for analyzing gameplay behaviors at scale, leading to the development of models for the assessment of implicit STEM learning.

We report on the design, evaluation, and outcomes of the Computational Thinking Unplugged for Science (CT-UP-S) professional development program for inservice science teachers. Our process-based approach to CT significantly improved teachers CT understanding and CT/science integration self-efficacy by systematically linking CT practices to scaffold the generation of unplugged algorithms. Additionally, we found that the process-based approach provided a framework for teachers' lesson planning and that teachers’ content knowledge moderated their ability to write CT-integrated science lessons.

AB  - Early evidence suggests that robot programming offers an important foundation for spatial reasoning and computational thinking; however, researchers have debated how to introduce young children to these skills. We explored how preschoolers develop understanding of spatial concepts and computational thinking as the children took turns navigating a path during guided play with a programmable robot. Our analysis of the data included a multimodal visualization of the exchanges between the teacher, children, and a programmable robotic device. The findings highlight the effects that arose from the physical-digital convergence of technology integrated into play including: (a) the robot evoked a chain of actions, enacting pedagogic forces that transformed children's learning; (b) children used their own bodies as spatial referents, co-locating themselves in space with the robot; (c) the teacher remained a key actor, providing verbal and nonverbal scaffolding to promote children's understanding and mastery of spatial and computational concepts; and (d) talking with the teacher about spatial concepts combined with the interactions with the robot enhanced children's acquisition of spatial ideas relative to the quantity of children's verbal expressions and complexity of their applied spatial skills and computational thinking.

AB  - Workers in the areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics play a significant role in the sustained growth and stability of the global economy, and, thus constitute a critical component in helping all countries worldwide to prosper. In this context, computational thinking constitutes an important skill to have as it enables workers to develop creative solutions to complex problems. Nonetheless, across all economies worldwide, there is a need to have more workers who are able to think through problems, challenges, and solutions in computational terms. It is thus of utmost importance to integrate the teaching of computational thinking in K-12 education in order to reduce the skills gap between education and the workplace. A pertinent and crucial question that arises is whether teachers have the knowledge and skills to teach students how to think computationally. Existing research shows that teacher education departments do not currently have the knowledge to promote computational thinking in their programs. The present study focuses on two aspects of computational thinking, such as, algorithmic thinking and debugging skills with the use of scaffolded programming scripts in an educational technology undergraduate course. The results show statistically significant learning gains in pre-service teachers’ algorithmic thinking and debugging skills in the context of robotic programming activities with LEGO WeDo. Limitations and future research directions are discussed.

AB  - Recent studies identify Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) as a key factor in enhancing cognitive development, particularly within Computational Thinking (CT) literature. However, research gaps remain in understanding how SRL and CT interact from a developmental perspective. Our study designed a program with tailored animations and worksheets to specifically foster students' learning and cognitive development. Using a mixed-methods approach, we administered surveys among 1235 students from 29 Hong Kong primary schools to investigate a dynamic learning system comprising SRL and CT in a large-scale CT program. Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 students to further probe insights. Quantitative findings revealed a mutually reinforcing relationship in the dynamic system, suggesting that higher SRL skills enhance cognitive CT abilities, and vice versa. Complementing these results, qualitative findings showed that integrating animations and worksheets into the CT program significantly boosted students' SRL and cognitive development. These findings have significant implications for educational practices and curriculum design. Schools should consider implementing SRL strategies, such as proactive goal setting and reflective evaluation, within their curricula to promote students’ cognitive development. Furthermore, strategic investments in educational technology, including collaborations with EdTech developers, are essential to create effective, pedagogically sound tools that enhance learning outcomes. These insights provide valuable guidance for creating a supportive SRL environment that fosters cognitive development in primary school education.

AB  - In recent years, there has been increasing interest in integrating Computational Thinking (CT) into elementary schools. However, few studies have focused on teachers’ perceptions. This study aims to examine teachers' perceptions to bridge the gap between theory and practice. The study analysed teachers’ perceptions of integrating CT into school subjects through the constructionist approach, using Scratch a leading programming platform inspired by Resnick's Lifelong Kindergarten Constructionist model. Over a school year, 31 teachers participated in a professional development program and applied this model in their classrooms. The teachers were interviewed to capture their perceptions of learning and teaching using a constructionist method. The findings revealed that teachers with creative arts experience fully embraced the model, while others partially adopted it. Teachers recognized the benefits of constructionist teaching in fostering creativity, motivation, and engagement among students. However, they struggled with balancing these benefits with school demands and constraints. Challenges included managing time effectively within constraints of school and ensuring curriculum alignment. Despite this, many teachers found that the constructionist approach positively impacted students' learning engagement and personal development. By addressing the identified challenges, teacher education designers, curriculum developers, and schools can develop practices for closing the gap between theory and practice.

AB  - Educational research on predicting learners’ computer programming performance has yielded practical implications that guide task designs in computer education. There have been attempts to investigate learners’ computer programming patterns using high-frequency and automated data collection. This approach can be considered as process-based analysis as opposed to outcome-based analysis (i.e., the use of test or exam scores). In this process-based approach to investigate learners’ computer programming process, we included two critical constructs in our research, self-regulated learning and computational thinking skills. We aimed to identify learners’ computer programming patterns in the context that novice students learn a computer programming language, Python, in an online coding environment. We examined the relationships between the learners’ coding patterns, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills. Initially, we adopted a traditional approach with the aggregate data of learners’ computer programming behaviors. We then utilized a computational analytics approach to learner performance, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills, with ever-changing computer programming patterns. In our initial approach, the indicators of aggregate computer programming data were not associated with learners' learning performance and computational thinking skills. In the computational analysis approach, many indicators revealed significant differences between the identified patterns regarding computational thinking skills and self-regulated learning. Recommendations about the use of programming log data analysis methods and future scaffolding for computer programming learners are addressed.

AB  - In the field of education, research has consistently emphasized mathematical creative thinking as a crucial component of 21st-century skills. Thus, this cross-sectional study examines the predictors of such thinking by specifically focusing on the roles of perceived creativity, creative self-efficacy, and computational thinking. The participants consisted of 896 secondary school students (52.9 % female; 47.1 % male) in Indonesia who were asked to complete a series of online questionnaires and tests. For analysis, structural equation modeling was employed, demonstrating satisfactory construct validity and instrument reliability. Based on the results, there was a positive association between computational thinking and mathematical creative thinking. In addition, perceived creativity had a positive impact on mathematical creative thinking, whereas creative self-efficacy showed a negative association. As for the empirical model, it revealed that computational thinking plays a mediating role, connecting perceived creativity and creative self-efficacy to mathematical creative thinking. The findings suggest that incorporating these skills and related variables into the mathematics curriculums in schools is essential for preparing students for success in the 21st century.

AB  - Previous studies have explored the relationship between computational thinking (CT) and creativity. However, a consensus has yet to be reached since both CT and creativity varied in ideation and assessment. To uncover the cognitive mechanism underlying the interplay between CT and creativity, we conduct a scoping review of 26 empirical studies published in 2006–2024. Our findings suggested that the effects of working memory varied in the interplay between CT and creativity due to differences in age range, neural network activation regions, and measurements. Intellectual abilities, including algorithmic fluency, reasoning ability, and coding ability, showed cognitive transfer effect on CT skills but not necessarily on creativity, suggesting that cognitive abilities embracing more intelligent elements may contribute to the functional connectivity in CT neural networks but only partly overlapped with creativity involved networks. Although executive functions (working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control) play a crucial role in both CT and creativity, their contributions to the CT-creativity interplay are still rarely studied. Future research should explore the CT-creativity relationship from the perspective of neuroscience.

AB  - This systematic review examined how computer science (CS) education was implemented in schools and its efficacy for developing students’ computational thinking (CT). Sixty-six papers were selected for this systematic review and analyzed for patterns in relation to the implementation of CS education in K-12 schools and its impact on the development of students’ CT skills. Although educational interventions have not always been successful in CS education, this review provides strong evidence that overall, CS education promotes the development of students’ CT in the K-12 setting while improving their creative and critical thinking skills. We recommend early access to CS education, various innovative instructional approaches to CS education and appropriate support and guidance for student learning.

AB  - Recently, the development of computational thinking (CT) skills has become widespread in the whole world. There is a consensus to develop students’ CT skills through unplugged and plugged-in programming. However, the choice of programming approaches taught in schools is arbitrary and few studies have compared the effectiveness differences between unplugged and plugged-in programming. This study aimed to explore the differences between unplugged and plugged-in programming in developing CT skills of students in Grades 1-2 students. It also explored the joint effects of students’ gender, programming experience, programming interest, and programming confidence with different programming approaches on CT skills. The quasi-experimental research approach was used to conduct 10 weeks of unplugged, plugged-in, and regular programming activities with 124 Grades 1-2 students. The results found that unplugged programming promoted CT skills more in the early primary grades than plugged-in programming. We found that boys and students with programming experience in unplugged group performed significantly better in CT skills than in plugged-in group. Moreover, the improvement of CT skills of students in unplugged group was positively correlated with the level of their programming interest and programming confidence. However, these were not observed in plugged-in group. The results of this study can provide precise guidance for teaching CT skills to early primary school students and provide references for CT education.

AB  - This paper presents an investigation that compares and analyzes the interactions of three groups of pre-and-primary school children with three different storytelling systems. We identify emerging patterns through which they engaged in what we refer to as narrative computational thinking. The latter describes broadened aspects of narrative literacy practices that are linked to computational thinking. By applying a multicase study approach and through various vignettes, we illustrate how children applied computational thinking to understand and influence the narrative possibilities offered by the different tools. Our results illustrate circumstances under which digital storytelling activities provide a favorable basis for narrative computational thinking, and that when computational thinking functions as a scaffold for story creation, it encourages a blend of creativity and computational thinking, providing a compelling approach to introducing emerging digital literacies to young children in a narrative context.

AB  - In this study, it is aimed to identify the computational thinking skills used by gifted and talented students in integrated STEM activities based on the EDP. The case study design, a qualitative research method, is employed in the study. The participants consist of gifted and talented students attending the Science and Arts Center. Integrated STEM activities based on the EDP were conducted over the course of ten weeks and among these activities, robotic and 3D modeling-based robot construction activities using Lego sets are addressed in the present study. The STEM activity booklet, researchers' fieldnotes, and teaching process video recordings were used as data collection tools in the study. Data that was collected was analyzed through content analysis. It was seen that gifted and talented students participating in integrated STEM activities based on the EDP make active use of critical thinking skills while providing explanations, making associations, questioning information, giving justifications, solving problems, thinking creatively, making generalizations, and attempting to convince others; as for the instances of defining problems, creating solutions, and evaluating the effectiveness of the solution, the students were observed to actively use their problem-solving skills. The detailed account provided by the study on the way robotic and 3D robot modeling activities improve the computational thinking skills of gifted and talented students contributes to the required educational support and to the existing body of literature.

AB  - In the artificial intelligence age, cultivating young children's computational thinking (CT) has sparked tremendous attention. Programmable robotics is a developmental-appropriate and screen-free means that provides young children with great opportunities to learn programming and develop CT. However, it is reported that young children might have difficulties learning abstract CT concepts. As a helpful pedagogical facilitator, metaphors can help turn abstract concepts into more concrete and clear concepts that learners are familiar with. Therefore, this research proposed a metaphor-based robot programming (MRP) approach and explored its impact on young children's CT and behavioral patterns. A total of 118 children aged 5–6 were recruited in this experiment with two conditions: the experimental group adopted the metaphor-based robot programming (MRP) approach while the control group used the conventional robot programming (CRP) approach. Results revealed that children who adopted the MRP approach outperformed children who adopted the CRP approach on CT. In addition, behavioral analysis indicated that the proposed MRP approach could facilitate children's superior learning performance and more positive learning behaviors, so as to help them achieve learning objectives. Accordingly, this study can provide insightful guidance and inspiration for future research on effective programming teaching and CT development for young children.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is a necessary skill for students. It is as important as the other essential skills such as reading, writing, and arithmetic. However, how to improve students’ CT in robotics is still to be explored. Hence, this study examined the effects of computer supported project-based learning (CSPBL) on students’ CT and learning engagement through comparing students’ CT and engagement in two courses instructed by the same instructor (one instructed with a traditional method, the other instructed with CSPBL). Participants were seventy-nine students from a university in China. Questionnaires, interviews, and project analysis were used to measure students’ CT and learning engagement. The comparative results of self-reports and final projects indicated that the CSPBL enhanced students’ CT. The simulation project training based on the SenseStudy learning platform in CSPBL helped students debug the programming code, optimize the algorithm design, and improve their algorithmic thinking, cooperation, and problem solving during the program error correction. The CSPBL also improved students’ engagement in learning, especially for those with more than one year of programming experience. It was found that the CSPBL was effective in terms of improving students’ CT and engagement in robotics learning. This study provides teachers with practical suggestions to conduct effective robotics instruction.

AB  - Malaysia has introduced computational thinking skills as part of a curriculum integration update to meet the global trends in 21st-century education, focusing on empowering digital literacy. Nevertheless, a preliminary investigation revealed an apparent lack of understanding of computational thinking skills in general among teachers. The study explores the feasibility of developing a localized E-learning system to train computational thinking skills among teachers. An E-learning system, termed as myCTGWBL, was developed on the basis of a newly proposed conceptual framework to present computational thinking teaching–learning repertoire to the teachers. The hypothesis is that myCTGWBL would develop teachers' computational thinking and its position in teaching–learning understanding. myCTGWBL relevance was tested through DeLone and McLean's information system and Urbach's collaboration quality construct. To determine the success factors, partial least squares structural equation modeling was used. A total of 369 teachers participated in a two-stage survey. Participants' understanding of computational thinking and perceptions were recorded at the pre- and post-intervention phases. Open-ended questions of the surveys were analyzed using a simple text analysis technique. The closed-ended questions surveys were analyzed using SPSS Statistics 22.0. A significant improvement in teachers' computational thinking teaching–learning repertoire in a relatively short period has been recorded. Teachers also demonstrated increased confidence in the future delivering computational thinking-based lessons. The E-learning conceptual framework has illustrated the predictive power between user intent, user satisfaction, and Computational thinking (CT) knowledge benefits. Results demonstrate that myCTGWBL could be used to guide future planning when establishing CT knowledge acquisition initiatives, particularly among teachers.

AB  - Efforts to incorporate computational thinking (CT) into academic courses have been gaining popularity. CT is a problem-solving skill that is crucial in the 21st century. CT may be used to support language education. Courses in English as a foreign language often need an effective writing component that includes writing organization and language use, as demonstrated by the poor writing samples often generated by students of these courses. To address the problems, CT, which is a higher-order mode of problem-solving and knowledge acquisition optimization, was used. The experimental group was instructed using the CT teaching model based on CT's essential components (decomposition, generalization, abstraction, algorithm, and evaluation), whereas the control group was taught using the conventional method. In total, 58 undergraduate students divided into two groups participated in this study. A combination of writing, CT skills, surveys, and interviews were used to collect data according to an experimental design. The collected quantitative data were analyzed through analysis of covariance and structural equation modeling, and the MAXQDA 2022software was used to analyze the collected qualitative data. The results of this study indicate that incorporating CT into an English writing course enhances the writing and higher-order thinking skills of students. The CT concepts helps students develop critical thinking skills by evaluating the text and identifying potential issues or improvements. Additionally, it allows students to use their skills to create unique writing solutions, which can boost English writing creativity.

AB  - Computational thinking education has become an increasingly popular topic among practitioners and researchers. However, rare is known how to effectively teach and learn computational thinking in early childhood education. To address this knowledge gap, this systematic review examined 26 studies on the teaching and learning of computational thinking in early childhood education from 2010 to 2022. The content knowledge, tools, pedagogical design, assessment methods, and learning outcomes were analyzed. Results indicated that, with age-appropriate instructional design, children could develop early concepts and skills of computational thinking, as well as other related skills such as communication, collaboration, and problem solving. Across the studies, we found that most studies used quantitative research methods, with direct assessment and observation being the most. Several challenges were identified: (1) achieving a deeper learning of computational thinking; (2) a lack of valid and reliable computational thinking assessments for children with a wider age range; (3) selecting appropriate learning tools; and (4) designing age-appropriate activities for young learners. Although with these challenges, computational thinking education could bring new learning opportunities and enhance children's computational thinking skills, as well as other non-cognitive skills such as critical thinking, body-material interaction, and hand-eye coordination. This systematic review informs future endeavors in theorizing a digital learning framework that can integrate computational thinking into early childhood education.

AB  - Teacher competencies encompass the dimensions of knowledge and attitudes, yet few studies have analysed teachers' latent profiles in relation to the interaction between these two dimensions. Latent profile analysis, which examines the interplay between variables to distinguish subgroups of individuals, has recently emerged in studies of computational thinking (CT) as a method for identifying student profiles. However, the latent profiles of CT teachers have not yet been analysed. We therefore analysed the latent profiles of a sample of 493 teachers who had participated in a teacher development programme in CT, according to their knowledge and perceived usefulness of CT. Three profiles were identified: (1) highly knowledgeable with high perceived usefulness, (2) knowledgeable with low perceived usefulness, and (3) less knowledgeable with low perceived usefulness. Qualitative data further triangulated these findings. We also examined the learning achievement of 12,105 students taught by these teachers. Students taught by highly knowledgeable teachers with a high perceived sense of usefulness demonstrated significantly better achievement than their peers. Our findings highlight the importance of nurturing both knowledge of and perceived usefulness in CT. They also provide valuable insights for similar teacher development programmes, emphasizing the importance of peer mentoring support for less knowledgeable teachers. Additionally, we underscore the value of having teachers create artefacts using CT for instructional purposes, allowing them to gain firsthand experience of its usefulness. As few studies have explored teachers' latent profiles based on the dimensions of knowledge and attitudes, the contribution of this study extends beyond the domain of CT.

AB  - We designed a controlled trial protocol that seeks to contribute to cognitive science by studying the effect of thought training on children's executive functions. The study design is a cluster randomized controlled trial, with intra-subject and inter-subject evaluation, with two parallel groups: an experimental group and a TAU control group. With three measures, pre-test, post-test, and follow-up after three months. The participants will be children aged 9 to 11. The allocation will be randomized by groups and not individually. The sample will be a minimum of 44 participants. The primary measures will be neuropsychological tests to assess executive functions. Secondary measures will be a computational thinking test, neuropsychological tests to assess metacognition and attention, and an acceptability scale. The experimental group will participate in the COGNI-MACHINE computational thinking training designed by the first author. The training frequency will be twice a week in 60 min sessions for 12 weeks. The TAU control group will receive computer science classes as usual during the same time as the experimental group. The evaluators taking the measurements will be blinded to the assignment. The investigators in charge of the intervention will be blinded to the results of the evaluations.

AB  - Negative feedback can temporarily relieve negative Chinese transfer (NCT) in English as a foreign language (EFL) syntactic writing by focusing only on the surface writing constructs, neglecting that EFL writing is an embodiment of the process by which higher-order thinking operates. To solve the problem, the researchers conducted a pretest, interventionist group dynamic assessment (IGDA) in the form of negative feedback based on computational thinking (CT), higher-order thinking, and post-test quasi-experimental design, with a control group receiving the direct correction feedback instructing model to mitigate the NCT in EFL syntactic writing. We analyzed the syntactic writing types and frequencies of the NCT obtained through repeated-measure ANOVA and confirmed by qualitative data through video recording. The results indicated that IGDA in the form of negative feedback based on CT principal skills could (1) significantly decrease syntactic writing errors caused by the NCT, (2) improve learners’ EFL writing performance, and finally, (3) elevate the computer as an essential mediation tool. This innovative instructing mode of intervening with writing constructs and higher-order thinking and bringing about deeper thinking and creativity contributes to the EFL writing teaching methodology in a foreign language higher education.

AB  - The tenure system in the United States places significant importance on teaching effectiveness. To date, students' evaluations of teaching (SETs) have been the reigning mechanism for assessing effective teaching. However, prior work has shown that SETs are often biased against underrepresented groups and minorities. The present study analyzes options for effective teaching assessments, which include evaluating final grades and measuring the differences between students’ pre- and post-tests (normalized gain) using standard instruments. The content area and the instrument used in this study originated in the computational thinking field, which has a widespread presence in engineering, where minorities are at a disadvantage. This study obtained a total of 88 student participants from four sections of an introductory engineering course at a Southwestern institution. The study utilized a computational thinking diagnostic (CTD) to inform the course teaching approach (the intervention). Results show that (a) normalized learning gains correlated moderately with SETs, (b) final grades correlated strongly with SETs, (c) final grades correlated strongly with normalized learning gains, (d) the educational intervention based on the CTD significantly affected student learning, and (e) SET comments affect evaluations. The implications include the notion that standardized instrument-driven instruction and evaluations can increase the success of minorities on both sides of the classroom. The purpose of this manuscript is to invite the Heliyon readership to get involved in the development of related instruments and to incorporate these measures of learning into their instruction so biases are avoided or minimized.

AB  - In the digital age, our lives become more dependent on technology, yet the digital gap is intensifying especially because most people lack digital literacy. As a modest step to handle this challenge, we designed a course named "Play with me in Code" to develop pre-service teachers' (PSTs) thinking skills and expose them to learning by creation using computational thinking and programming as part of the constructionism paradigm. The added value of using Scratch in the context of teacher education lies not only in familiarity with a programming language but with an emphasis on experiencing self-directed learning tackling with problem solving situations, creativity, socioemotional competencies, and logical computational thinking. The present study aims to examine 25 PSTs' attitudes towards facing challenges of coding with Scratch. To this end, a mixed-method approach was activated by using questionnaires, blog posts, and reflections. Findings revealed that the learning environment encouraged PSTs' use of abstraction and decomposition to address a complex problem or to design a complex game. Study's conclusions relate to the importance of providing PSTs opportunities to experience learning by programming for raising their awareness of the importance of enhancing thinking skills and creativity in the future.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT), a way to think about solving problems, is recognized as a basic skill for the 21st century. Although game-based learning (GBL) has been shown to improve student's CT skills, students may fail to self-evaluate or debate as they play games, thus failing to develop higher-order thinking. Also not widely explored is how teachers are to practice the CT core competencies during the learning process to cultivate students' problem-solving thinking. As the adoption of student-generated questions (SGQ) is an instructional strategy to promote higher-order thinking, we develop a GBL platform that uses this strategy to enhance students' CT skills, learning motivation, and learning confidence. For this purpose, fifty-three primary school students were recruited for this study, and data were collected during four classes of experimental CT activities. This study shows that the experimental group using the SGQ strategy with a GBL platform exhibited significantly higher CT skills than the control group. In addition, with respect to learning motivation and learning confidence it is found that the experimental group also outperformed the control group. This confirms that integrating the SGQ strategy and CT core competencies fosters higher-order cognitive thinking in students in problem-solving through gamification of the learning environment, resulting in higher motivation and confidence to complete experimental activities.

AB  - To effectively utilize artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies such as ChatGPT and realize their novel ethical issues, individuals must have a variety of knowledge and skills about AI. Such knowledge and skills have led to the emergence of AI literacy. Despite the importance of AI literacy in everyday life, little is known about its determinants. To better understand the determinants of AI literacy, we attempted to build a research model relying on previous research and different theoretical frameworks. The model incorporated digital divide, cognitive absorption, and computational thinking. As a major finding from the current study, computational thinking was found to be a significant determinant of AI literacy, which facilitate using, recognizing, and evaluating AI-based technologies. Moreover, we found out that individuals with physical access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) are more expected to use and recognize AI. Also, motivation and skills in using ICTs enable individuals to better evaluate the outcomes of AI-based technologies. The findings also showed that convenient access to ICTs contributes to a deep involvement with AI-based technologies in the use. Further, individuals with higher motivation and skills to use AI technologies are likely to have a pleasant experience after using these technologies.

AB  - Both computational thinking (CT) and creativity have been recognized as key skills for today's learners. Over the last decade, research of both skills in a single context has emerged. In this paper, we present a scoping review of 62 such empirical from 2011 to 2020. Our goal was to have a thorough understanding of the educational settings in which research on both CT and creativity was conducted, the theoretical foundations it has laid down, and the research tools used. Our findings indicate a geographical bias (dominance of the US and prominence of developed European countries), as well as a focus on secondary education and on STEM-related disciplines; this could be explained by the current situation of CT spread. We also found that when studying CT and creativity jointly, it is most common to define CT in a broader perspective than merely programming of computer science. Additionally, while creativity is largely referred to as product-related, CT is barely referred to as such. Taken together, our findings point out some gaps in the current research of CT and creativity and suggest how it should be expended on the fertile grounds of creativity, as the latter crosses geographical, age, and subject borders. Doing so may build a bridge between CT and creativity in a way that will benefit both.

AB  - This paper sheds light on 3–5-year-old children’s enactments of computational empowerment (CE) in activities with computational thinking (CT). CT is widely elaborated on as a universal problem-solving approach and a skill set necessary for thriving in today’s digitized societies. Scholars claim that CT for all should be ensured from an early age, and several studies develop and examine age-appropriate technological tools, as well as pedagogical approaches, for young children’s learning of CT. Based on 1.5 years of co-designing for children’s situated CT in two Danish kindergartens, the present study conducts a socioculturally informed analysis of video-observed interactions between children and educational robots. The findings display how children and robots engage in interactions that transcend children’s mastery of CT in any narrow sense. This is examined as situated enactments of CE; as children’s critical and informed decisions regarding the roles that technologies, in this case educational robots, can play in their institutionally situated social lives. The paper concludes that children’s various enactments of CE deserve scholarly and professional attention, both as an important prerequisite for, and as a necessary limitation to, the implementation of CT in kindergartens.

AB  - Since the end of the 20th century, the digitalization of society, including the educational systems, has been growing exponentially. At the same time, education systems have been evolving towards competency-based assessment. Likewise, at the beginning of this century, the idea of Computational Thinking was resurrected by J. Wing, for solving problems and designing systems using concepts of computer science. Today, we can see how all these questions are taking shape in a new competence, called Computational Thinking, related to others that already exist. In this paper, we have studied the skills of Computational Thinking in university students, focusing on abstraction and its possible relationship with other factors. Results conclude that the students fail in relation to abstraction and in algorithmic thinking. Although the ability of abstraction is not easy to measure, a linear regression analysis has been carried out in order to determine its possible study.

AB  - Teaching computational thinking (CT) has become a priority for educators and policymakers tasked with educating and training students for future jobs which are predicted to be increasingly automated. Recent research on effective instructional interventions for developing computational thinking skills, including algorithmic and critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity, and cooperativity, suggests that teaching and learning CT can improve student academic performance. In fact, the extant literature is quite sanguine about the topic of CT. However, few studies have attempted to establish a relationship between CT skills and academic performance. In the present cross-sectional study, we employ path analysis to model the structural relationship between self-reported CT skills and academic performance of a sample of 81 computer science undergraduates enrolled at a Southwestern American university. We found few direct relationships between CT skills and academic performance. We only find a significant positive relationship between creativity and academic performance and a significant negative relationship between cooperativity and academic performance. Our findings are surprising considering the abundant research promoting computational thinking as a key component of 21st century skills. The findings call for further in-depth analysis of computational thinking and the influence on students’ learning and learning outcomes. We discuss our results with respect to recent educational mandates for including CT and instructional alignment in school curricula. Our findings contribute to the existing discussion by helping to clarify the relationship between CT skills and academic performance in higher education.

AB  - Although studies have shown that computational thinking (CT) can enhance learning processes and outcomes across traditional subjects, they have not shown how teachers might scaffold children's CT processes in a technology-mediated learning context. This exploratory study examined how teacher talk and technologies impacted the CT of three children (6 to 8 years old). Seven videotaped 90-minute sessions of weekly project-based activities yielded 4,842 turns of talk (2,974 by children). Statistical discourse analysis revealed the following results. After a teacher command, the children more often executed a sequence of actions toward a solution but less often demonstrated problem understanding than otherwise. Following a teacher's open question, the children were more likely to offer logically organized ideas. In response to a teacher's rhetorical question, they more often searched for information. These results inform educators regarding when to use each type of teacher talk to scaffold children's CT processes.

AB  - ChatGPT (generative pre-trained transformer) is one of the artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that have started to be used in programming education. However, the effect of using ChatGPT in programming education on learning processes and outcomes is not yet known. This study investigated the effect of programming education using the ChatGPT on students' computational thinking skills, programming self-efficacy, and motivation toward the lesson. The research was conducted on 45 undergraduate students who took a university-level programming course. The research was carried out according to the experimental design with the pretest-posttest control group. Students were randomly divided into experimental (n = 21) and control (n = 24) groups. While the experimental group students benefited from the ChatGPT during the weekly programming practices, the control group students did not use this tool. Research data were obtained through the computational thinking scale, computer programming self-efficacy scale, and learning motivation in computer programming courses scale. Research findings revealed that the experimental group students' computational thinking skills, programming self-efficacy, and motivation for the lesson were significantly higher than the control group students. In line with this result, it can be said that it may be useful to benefit from AI technologies such as ChatGPT in programming trainings. The research findings, it was emphasized how the most effective use of AI support in the lessons could be made, and various suggestions were made for researchers and educators in this regard.

AB  - In this paper, we explore how the theoretical notion of possibility space offers a way to study how children's computational thinking develops as a process. Drawing on embodied notions of cognition, we first examine the literature that supports how children's computational thinking emerges as a possibility space that involves conceptualizing possible actions in a given moment, deciding which action to take by anticipating the results of a possible action, and learning from the actions that they have taken. We then use a grounded approach to analyze the problem-solving process of two 5th-grade children who engaged in an educational robotics activity over two 50-minute class periods. The findings lend support for approaching children's computational thinking as a cycle of action-taking that includes conceptualizing, anticipating, and taking action. The findings also support the pedagogical practice of having children predict the results of a computer program to enhance their computational thinking. Implications for the way that teachers can support children in learning to conceptualize what is possible and take action from it are discussed.

AB  - Predictive learner modelling is crucial for personalized education. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great success in education, their potential in learner modelling via image data is unexplored. This research introduces a novel and interpretable approach for Image-based Learner Modelling (ImageLM) using CNNs and transfer learning to model learners’ performance and accordingly classify their computational thinking solutions. The approach integrates Grad-CAM, enabling it to provide insights into its decision-making process. Findings show that our custom CNN outperforms other models (namely ResNet, VGG, and Inception), with 83% accuracy in predicting solution correctness. More importantly, the ImageLM approach identifies the regions that contribute the most to the predictions, shedding light on learners' computational thinking knowledge and advancing toward trustworthy AI for education. These results underline the potential of utilizing imagery data from learners’ activities during the learning process to predict their performance, especially in challenging environments like programming where traditional feature extraction and learning might struggle.

AB  - The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has led to the proliferation of computational thinking (CT) education. However, research on unplugged activities’ influence in elementary math classrooms is limited, despite some exploring programming's cognitive benefits. This study presents both qualitative and quantitative analyzes stemming from a ten-week quasi-experimental research endeavor, specifically tailored for third-grade students. The research devised a series of unplugged activities, encompassing mathematical games, hands-on construction of mathematical logic boards, and calculating shopping discounts. The overarching objective was to investigate the impact of these unplugged activities on students’ mathematical creativity and CT. Students participating in a mathematics curriculum based on unplugged activities (N = 47) were compared with students participating in a traditional lecture-based mathematics curriculum (N = 46). The results indicated that unplugged activities exhibited significant advantages in fostering students’ CT and mathematical creativity across three dimensions, namely, problem-posing creativity (t = 5.830, p < 0.01), problem-solving creativity (t = 6.633, p < 0.01), and creative self-efficacy (t = 7.554, p < 0.01). Furthermore, the study revealed a relationship between students’ mathematical creativity as a predictor of CT. The results of the quantitative analysis were supported by the teacher's and students’ interview data, and the students felt excited and interested in the unplugged activities, whereas some students using the lecture-based method reported boredom and lack of interactivity. This research offered valuable insights for mathematics and CT education practice, underscoring unplugged activity as an innovative instructional approach that brings forth new possibilities for traditional mathematics teaching, with potential applications in the K-12 curriculum.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has received worldwide attention due to its alignment with developing 21st century skills such as creativity, problem-solving, and digital competence. With the increasing provision of programming tools such as robotic toys and tablet apps in the sector of early childhood education (ECE), many ECE researchers and practitioners tend to link CT to programming. However, children are reluctant to sustain their interests in programming activities, and may be further demotivated by debugging failures. This multi-group quasi-experimental study aimed to evaluate the effects of a story-inspired approach in bridging the gap between programming and CT for preschool children. Building on previous literature suggesting storytelling as a powerful, culturally responsive pedagogy, 5-year-old children (N=108) were involved in nine weeks of CT learning via one of the three conditions: Story-Inspired Robot Programming (SIRP), Story-Inspired Tablet Programming (SITP), and unplugged CT education. Results revealed that children who participated in the SIRP and SITP conditions showed improved CT scores, relative to unplugged CT education, even after controlling for baseline CT scores. No gender or family socioeconomic effects were found to influence the benefits of story-inspired programming interventions. These findings suggest that storytelling as a culturally responsive approach, whether using robots or tablets as a programming tool, can provide young children with more inclusive and sustainable CT learning experiences.

AB  - Content area K-12 teachers are increasingly asked to integrate computing and computational thinking into their classrooms, yet they often have little experience with computing. The purpose of this study was to understand how science teachers, new to computing and integrating computational thinking into their classrooms, supported students as computational problem solvers. In the project from which this research was drawn, 8th grade science teachers in three US school districts integrated computer game design into their study of climate systems and climate change. We conducted participant observation, collected teacher implementation logs and interviewed 15 teachers engaged in the three-year design research project, Building Systems from Scratch. Analysis through grounded theory yielded several results related to teachers’ orientations, strategies, and use of resources to create systems of distributed expertise. We identified five major themes: a) releasing responsibility to students, b) co-learning with students, c) encouraging students’ independent problem solving, d) building interdependence among students, and e) providing multiple other resources. Findings are discussed in relation to the literature on integrating computational thinking into content area classrooms.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is currently used as an umbrella term in education to describe the processes associated with learning and applying computer science concepts and strategies for problem-solving. Despite a growing body of literature on the subject within education and the development of a grand variety of tools designed to enhance computational thinking abilities, the relations between CT and other cognitive abilities have not been reported in young children. Understanding CT from a cognitive development perspective could be useful for creating targeted interventions tailored for young children. In the present study, we compare a previously reported computational thinking assessment with a battery of nine cognitive tests, which include fluid intelligence, working memory, planning, sequencing, mental rotation, vocabulary, and early math precursors such as numerical transcoding and symbolic magnitude comparison. Mixed-effects linear regressions were implemented with CT as a dependent variable to explore the associations between our variables. A subsample of children who participated in an educational robotics intervention were assessed in their robot programming performance, and its outcomes were compared with their CT assessments. Results suggest temporal sequencing ability and symbolic magnitude comparison are significant predictors of CT in kindergarten. Positive significant associations between robot programming and CT performance are reported.

AB  - The research aims to evaluate the effect of a robotics-based computational thinking program on executive functions and visuospatial skills in preschool children. Additionally, the study will explore the relationship between these three variables and early experiences with toys. The study will be a cluster-randomized controlled trial with pre- and post-intervention measures. Participants will be preschool children aged 5 to 6 years from both public and private institutions. The intervention will involve a new educational robotics device called ROVERSA and will consist of eight sessions distributed over four weeks, with the experimental group placed on a waitlist. To assess executive functions and visuospatial skills, standardized and validated neuropsychological measures will be used, including the Flanker task, the NIH Toolbox Card Sorting Test, the Corsi Block Test, the NEPSY-II Mental Rotation Test, the Pyramid of Mexico from the ENI-2 battery, and the Computational Thinking Test (CTt). Data analysis will begin with a hypothesis tested through ANOVA-MR, and linear regressions will be implemented to assess the relationship between variables. It is expected that the results will contribute to the discussion on teaching computational thinking and educational robotics as early learning experiences and their impact on the cognitive development of children.

AB  - This study examined the impact of a 10-month STEM professional development (PD) program on 25 teachers working with gifted students. The program aimed to enhance pedagogical knowledge and competencies. Findings indicated significant positive improvements in teachers' STEM self-efficacy, computational thinking, and entrepreneurship skills. The PD program also had a direct positive influence on the quality of lesson plans. The study suggests that effective PD design should incorporate scientific inquiry, engineering design processes, computational thinking, entrepreneurship skills, and the development of teachers' self-efficacy for successful implementation of PD outcomes in STEM education.

AB  - Educators emphasize that computational thinking is especially helpful in raising problem-solving skills, improving logical reasoning, and developing analytical thinking. In this context, the aim of this study is to develop an online, interactive, valid, reliable and useful performance-based assessment tool for measuring computational thinking skills. Data were collected in two stages with three different measurement tools. In the data collection phase, a psychometric scale, a skill test and an interactive web application developed in this study were used. In the study in which a total of 203 high school students participated, it was determined that the students' computational thinking skills were at average level. as a result, a valid and reliable performance-based platform was developed for measuring computational thinking skills. It has also been concluded that the performance-based measurement tool makes a better measurement than the psychometric scale. It is emphasized that computational thinking should be treated as a skill or group of skills, not as a theoretical knowledge, product/portfolio or attitude/perception. Therefore, it is believed that developing performance-based tools for evaluating computational thinking skills and measuring them by using multiple measurement tools will give more accurate results. Considering the developments in computational thinking, it is thought that the study will contribute to the literature.

AB  - Computing education has progressively entered into children's early years. Due to a proliferation of computing education programs and coding tools designed for young children, research on the relationships between computational thinking (CT) and other domains of learning and development is highly warranted. Yet, there is little empirical evidence that shows the relationship between CT and children's overall cognitive functioning. As such, this study explored the relationships between Chinese children's CT and their sequencing ability and self-regulation in early childhood. One hundred and one Chinese young children (Ngirl = 52 and Nboy = 49; Mage = 5.25, SD = 0.73) were recruited and evaluated with three reliable instruments. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that: (1) CT positively predicted sequencing ability (β = 0.27, p < .05) even after controlling for relevant demographic covariates such as age, gender, and family socioeconomic status; (2) CT positively predicted self-regulation (β = 0.47, p < .001) after controlling for demographic covariates. Our findings suggest that CT may be a domain-general ability that is based on cognitive foundations that extend beyond the realm of computing.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is regarded as the conceptual basis required for identifying and solving real-world problems through algorithmic approaches to achieve transferable solutions. Developing students' CT in primary school stages is essential and has received considerable attention. Meanwhile, researchers incorporated digital badges into classrooms to improve students' learning motivation in computer science (CS). However, few solid empirical studies analyze the effects of the digital badges approach in CS education to develop students' CT. Therefore, to bridge this gap, this study designed and implemented a block-based programming course in a primary school and examined the impact of the digital badges approach on pupils' CT skills and self-efficacy and learning motivation in CS. A quasi-experimental design was conducted among 99 third-grade students across three classes. The results revealed that the adapted digital badges in primary school (1) significantly improved the students' CT skills, (2) had no significant positive impact on their CT self-efficacy or learning motivation in CS, and (3) showed no mediating effect of learning motivation on the relationship between CT skills and CT self-efficacy. In addition, we found that whether students could see only their own digital badges or also those of others had no impact on CT skills, self-efficacy, or learning motivation in CS. These findings have implications for the design of digital badge educational interventions intended to promote students' CT and learning motivation.

AB  - Computational thinking refers to a series of cognitive processes involved in solving problems through computational systems. A growing body of studies has managed to demonstrate the correlation between computational thinking and different cognitive domains. In recent decades, multiple studies have taken place that seek to evaluate the effect of computational thinking on higher-order cognitive processes. The current study aims to contribute to this discussion by analyzing the effect of an intervention program in computational thinking on the executive functions of school-age children. In this experimental study, 30 children aged 10 and 11 were randomly assigned to an experimental group and an active control group. The instruments to collect the data were 15 tests of the neuropsychological battery of executive functions and frontal lobes BANFE-2, which were applied to both groups before and after the intervention. The experimental group participated in an 8-week computational thinking intervention during which its participants enrolled in plugged and unplugged activities and carried out block programming language twice a week. The results showed that the intervention had significant effects on executive functions associated with the anterior prefrontal cortex and the dorsolateral cortex, but not those related to the orbitofrontal area.

AB  - Learning coding during early childhood is an effective way for children to practice computational thinking. Aspects of children's motivation can increase the likelihood that children approach computational thinking activities with enthusiasm and deep engagement. Gender inequities may interfere with children's readiness to take advantage of opportunities to build computational thinking skills through activities such as coding. Societal stereotypes can reduce young girls’ motivation to engage with computer science, preventing them from gaining benefits from coding activities designed to support computational thinking. This study examined children's gender stereotypes as well as children's own motivation for computer coding in 363 first- through third-grade children. We assessed gender differences in both stereotypes and motivation, as well as links between the stereotypes that individual children held and their own motivation. Children generally endorsed stereotypes about interest and ability for computer coding that favored their own-gender group, although third-grade girls reported gender-egalitarian beliefs about interest in coding. There were no gender differences in children's motivation for computer coding in terms of their own interest, sense of belonging, or ability self-concepts. Children's stereotypes about their own-gender group were significantly positively correlated with their own motivation for computer coding. These findings suggest that early childhood represents an excellent age for children to begin building computational thinking skills, before girls endorse negative stereotypes about their gender's interest in computer science.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is an essential skill students need if they are to adapt to the rise of digital society, and the evaluation of CT is crucial for enhancing students’ CT. However, the current evaluation of CT is based on a summative paradigm and ignores real CT performance during the assessment process. This study thus used a multimodal cognitive diagnostic model (H-MCDM) of students’ CT based on multimodal data in situational tasks, to achieve precise evaluation and explore the current mastery status of students’ CT and their cognitive and behavioral characteristics. The research results indicate that: 1) students’ CT was at a moderately high level and indicated a good grasp of the CT components of problem decomposition and algorithm design, but students had not yet mastered problem abstraction, 2) a total of six different CT latent patterns were discerned in the overall student results, 3) individual students who shared the same CT latent patterns could differ in their cognitive and behavioral characteristics, while those with different CT latent patterns could share similar characteristics. This study showed that it is possible to capture the degree of students’ mastery of CT and their cognitive and behavioral differences with the same or different CT latent patterns at a granular level, providing a basis for developing individualized strategies to enhance students’ CT.

AB  - In-service elementary school teachers need training to teach computational thinking (CT). A common model for CT professional learning programs includes an initial workshop followed by ongoing support. However, little research has examined the efficacy of ongoing support, the most effective types, and its impact on classroom practices. The current study details a multifaceted CT professional learning program with innovative ongoing support to help elementary school teachers implement the Code.org curriculum. It also empirically investigated the impact of the support on teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT, the effectiveness of each component of the support, and to what extent it affected teachers' classroom practices. Our ongoing support included an additional workshop, grade-level professional learning community (PLC) sessions, instructional videos, and teacher leaders' support. Data included a pre-survey, four post-surveys, lesson observations, a focus group interview, tracking the number of video views, and surveys from PLC participants and teacher leaders. Results indicated that the ongoing support significantly increased teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT. Regarding the effectiveness of the various components of the ongoing support, the additional workshop significantly increased teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT. Teachers valued each component of the support, and this support improved teachers’ classroom practices.

AB  - The present study investigates the debugging process of 526 children in preschool (4–6 aged) when programming a tangible robot. When a child is involved in programming, it is needed to identify and correct errors, or in other words, debug a program. Debugging is a high-level thinking skill and is an essential component closely related to developing Computational Thinking in early childhood education. Though the debugging process is a cognitive function in programming investigated by many researchers in recent decades, most studies are conducted either in primary, secondary education, or higher education concerning beginners or experts in programming. Very few reviews, and some focus on preschool education. Our study set out the following objectives: 1) How do children identify the existence of error and locate it? 2) What types of errors emerge when coding? 3) What type of error is complex for novice programmers? 4) What strategies are developed by novice programmers to debug effectively? and 5) What types of knowledge do novice programmers construct by debugging the tangible robot Bee-Bot? The study follows an iterative model of a design-based research approach. It uses multiple case studies to collect qualitative and quantitative data. The programming intervention was implemented by 30 educators in their classrooms and was based on a scenario-based teaching design. The debugging process was analysed using Klahr & Craven's framework (1988): 1) test and evaluate program, 2) identify bug, 3) represent program, 4) locate bug and 5) correct bug. The main finding is the construction and development of syntactic and semantic knowledge.

AB  - A plethora of programming platforms purports to teach preschool-aged children computational thinking (CT) and coding skills. However, the empirical evidence to support their effectiveness is still in its early stages. A three-week didactic intervention using ScratchJr was conducted to investigate its effectiveness in fostering CT and rudimentary coding skills in a cohort of preschool children (N = 34, aged 4–6 years). While the initial performance mean of the control group (M = 7.07, SD = 2.58) exhibits a statistically significant elevation t (22.64 = 2.23, p = 0.036) vis-à-vis the experimental group (M = 5.35, SD = 1.58), t (22.64) = 2.23, p = 0.0 the terminal performance means of both groups converge closely. However, meticulous data analysis unveils a statistically notable enhancement among preschool participants exposed to the educational intervention involving ScratchJr. Notably, both instructional modalities appear commensurate in nurturing elementary computational tenets, namely modularity and control structures. The experimental cohort outperforms the control group with statistical significance in comprehending potent ideational constructs encompassing representation, algorithms, and hardware/software interplay. Conversely, the control group performs better in grasping the debugging concept than their experimental counterparts. The outcomes lend substantive credence to the efficacy of the distinct programming milieu offered by ScratchJr, underscoring its effectiveness in cultivating CT and coding proficiencies within the preschool demographic.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is crucial for students. Robot-supported learning has emerged as a popular approach for CT cultivation. To understand the effects of robot-supported CT cultivation, the current study conducted a meta-analysis to analyze studies from Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Science Direct databases (2012–2022) which screened using keywords ``computational thinking'' and ``robot''. After further screening, 26 peer-reviewed articles were selected. We synthesized the 33 effect sizes to assess the overall effectiveness of robot-supported learning on CT and its sub-dimensions: concepts, practices, and perspectives. Our findings revealed a medium effect of robot-supported learning on students' CT (g = 0.643), a large effect on CT concepts (g = 0.650), a medium effect on CT practices (g = 0.587), and a huge effect on CT perspectives (g = 1.419). We also explored the moderators (i.e., grade level, study duration, culture, learning strategy, and assessment tool) that might influence the effects of robot-supported CT cultivation. Moderator analyses indicated that short-term (less than four weeks) robot-supported learning had a larger effect (g = 0.901) on CT practice than long-term (more than eleven weeks) learning (g = 0.309). This meta-analysis indicates that educators could apply robot-supported learning to cultivate students' CT and concludes with related implications.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has gained increasing recognition as a 21st-century competency. Although initiatives have been taken to define the term for educational practices, limited empirical evidence is available to clarify its underlying components, especially at the primary education level. This study aimed to identify the associations between CT and specific cognitive skills in the primary school context. Based on the literature, three cognitive domains were studied (i.e., mathematical, visuospatial, and reasoning skills) and standard test batteries were applied to a sample of 633 primary students (aged 7–12 years). Linear regression analyses were performed with CT performance as the dependent variable to investigate its associations with the measured cognitive skills, and demographic features (i.e., age, gender) and coding learning experience (i.e., years of coding experience, extra-curricular coding experience) were included as control variables. The results indicated that the students’ CT performance was significantly predicted by their attainments in numeracy, visual perception, spatial visualisation, and inductive reasoning, and the results remained significant after controlling for demographics and coding experience. The study adds to the literature by enriching the understanding of CT as a psychological construct and has practical implications for educational stakeholders regarding the importance of interdisciplinary teaching and the integration of specific cognitive skills into CT learning activities.

AB  - The sustainable and digital future of work may imply a dramatic equilibrium change between social factors and technological ones. We argue that providing suitable tools to support End-User Development (EUD) in the workplace could represent a way to cope with such future changes. The contributions of this paper include the analysis and characterization of the most used EUD techniques and their crossover with a new conveyed model of Computational Thinking. The synthesis between these aspects is made explicit in the construct of EUDability, which is designed to capture the quality dimensions of EUD systems suitable to work scenarios where better roles and better tools for individuals may be shaped. EUDability has to do with identifying and assessing the difficulties of EUD techniques on one side and the Computational Thinking skills held by individuals on the other side.

AB  - There has been an increasing interest in the integration of technology into language education. Meanwhile, computational thinking (CT) skills are fostered which influence communicative language teaching and learning. Despite CT's established importance in science education, its significance in language teaching remains scarce. This study contributes to knowledge synthesis and methodological development by reviewing 16 journal articles, analyzing CT applications in language learning across educational contexts, intervention tools, CT skills, language acquisition, and assessment methods. The results indicate that (a) more CT-involved activities are needed for primary, secondary, and tertiary education, (b) educational robots and Scratch stand out as the most trending intervention tools, (c) CT skills such as decomposition, abstraction, generalization and so on have a positive effect on students’ foreign language acquisition, especially in grammar and writing, (d) assessment of CT development can be surveyed through a validated and reliable instrument such as computer programming self-efficacy scale or an online platform: Dr. Scratch; Conversely, there is a diversity of evaluation tools in foreign language learning. This study is the first to review experimental research on integrating computational thinking into foreign language learning and offers significant implications for future research.

AB  - The development of programming skills and computational thinking in the formal educational context is one of the most recent horizons set by many educational systems worldwide. Although the first computational thinking initiatives are being applied from the earliest school ages, this research focuses on the secondary education level. Specifically, the objective is the following: to analyse the implementation of Arduino, as well as the benefits and opportunities it brings to secondary school students. For this purpose, documentary research has been undertaken applying a systematic review according to the PRISMA 2020 framework following the PiCoS strategy. Atlas.ti 9 was used to analyse the information. Out of 316 papers identified, 37 were included in the research. In relation to the results, Arduino is primarily used in technology and physics subjects, although it is also used to develop interdisciplinary STEAM projects. As a rule, it is used to learn programming languages, but likewise as a resource to develop science experiments. LED lights, servomotors and breadboards are among the most commonly used resources together with the Arduino board. and Scratch was the most widely used software. The initiatives implemented have yielded both positive and negative results, for example, one drawback is that some projects are very difficult, and some achievements such as: increased motivation towards the contents addressed or also the development of some soft skills, such as problem solving.

AB  - Recently, virtual reality (VR) technology has shown great potential in advancing education with many pedagogical benefits for building the 21st-century teaching and learning experience. This study conducted a formative evaluation of an immersive VR expedition application with the aim of understanding users' learning processes and how the application facilitates higher education students' computational thinking skills. Six participants were randomly selected to conduct this evaluation. A mixed research approach consisting of quantitative and qualitative methods was employed. The study quantitatively analyzed users' scores from gameplay to understand how the intervention supported computational thinking skills. Participants were also interviewed to collect data after playing the mini-games to investigate users' experiences. The study showcases players' computational thinking competency, assessed automatically during gameplay. Further, this study used inductive content analysis to demonstrate users' reactions to prototyped VR mini-games. The qualitative findings suggest that users found the VR mini-games interactive and immersive, which provided an opportunity to foster learners' computational thinking skills. The quantitative analysis revealed that student's computational thinking competency can be enhanced through consistent playing of the mini-games. Moreover, the expedition aspect of the VR game stimulated learners' curiosity, which sustained their learning progress. Furthermore, users gained new knowledge and found the mini-games educative. Nevertheless, several aspects of the VR mini-games need improvements, according to users' perceptions. This study contributes to the knowledge in terms of the affordances of VR in education research and provides relevant insights that can shape future studies, for example, the recent hype of metaverse in education.

AB  - Project-Based Learning (PBL) and Computational Thinking (CT), a teaching strategy and a problem-solving method, respectively, have been widely used in teaching and learning because of their educational advantages for students and teachers. However, studies of their integration into the teaching and learning process have been scarce, resulting in a lack of guidance for educators to implement such an approach that apply constructivism learning theory. This study aims to systematically review and identify appropriate frameworks, models, techniques and tools that could guide the successful implementation of PBL-CT. This study examined relevant articles published from 2017 to 2021 to highlight the gaps in the PBL-CT execution and map their backgrounds into a coherent taxonomy that could help guide the directions of future studies. As revealed, none of such articles explicitly explain any suitable PBL-CT frameworks or models. The study identified several common elements for the PBL-CT framework formulation, indicating scaffolding and inquiry are the most commonly applied techniques, with visual tools dominating the PBL-CT implementation. Most articles involved computing, followed by STEM, with a few originating from non-STEM fields. Several important implications could help educators develop an effective PBL-CT course design and provide some guidelines for future research. An effective PBL-CT integration enhances teaching and learning besides improving students' computational thinking skills. Thinking skills are critical 21st-century skills needed for students' success.

AB  - Computational thinking has become an integral component of curricula worldwide, necessitating teachers to develop this competence in their students. To effectively meet these curricular requirements, teachers themselves need a solid foundation of computational thinking content knowledge, which refers to the understanding and skills they possess in this area. However, despite widespread recognition of this need, few studies have rigorously examined teachers' content knowledge in this domain. Addressing this gap requires the development of high-quality measurement tools. This study details the development of an instrument, created as part of the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) 2023 in Flanders, to measure lower secondary school teachers' computational thinking content knowledge in a valid and reliable way. The article first outlines the construction process of the instrument, which involved close collaboration with experts in the field and drew upon the framework of Fraillon et al. (2023). Following this, the instrument's psychometric properties are presented, which include both item-level and overall instrument characteristics. These properties were evaluated using data from a sample of 352 participants, applying both Classical Test Theory and Item Response Theory. The final tool consists of sixteen multiple-choice and short constructed response questions. The results indicate favorable item and overall instrument characteristics, thereby affirming its potential to measure the intended construct in a valid and accurate way.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) skills help students both understand and utilize computing in various domains to cope with the challenges posed by the complex digital world. This study applied mind mapping to programming language instruction in a primary school, and explored the effects of mind mapping on students' CT skills when learning programming with Scratch as a programming tool. Two types of mind mapping, construct-by-self mind mapping (CBS-MM) and construct-on-scaffold mind mapping (COS-MM), were proposed to compare which type is more effective in terms of students' CT skills. Seventy-three public primary school fifth-grade students aged 10 to 11 participated in the study. The CBS group included 33 students learning with the CBS-MM instructional approach, while the COS group comprised 40 students learning with the COS-MM instructional approach. Data were obtained from nine topic Scratch programming assignments and pre- and post-CT skills surveys completed by the two groups. Paired sample t tests were used to analyze whether the two types of mind mapping approach could improve both groups' CT skills. One-way ANCOVA and one-way ANOVA were used to examine the difference in the two groups' CT skills. The results showed that both CBS-MM and COS-MM can improve students' CT skills; however, the COS group students could better improve their CT skills with the assistance of the COS-MM method compared with the CBS group students who learned with the CBS-MM method. The findings of this study can provide some enlightenment for relevant instructors to design instruction and implement programming teaching with different kinds of mind mapping support that facilitates students’ CT.

AB  - The specific mechanisms by which teachers and parents can provide culturally relevant opportunities for computational thinking for racially/ethnically and linguistically diverse groups of preschoolers remain unknown. Accordingly, the purpose of this research is to examine how PreK parent and teacher voice directed efforts to realize a culturally relevant computing program. We drew data sources from a subsample of design-based research meetings in which partners collaborated to co-develop the first iteration of the program. Using qualitative analysis, we examined how parent voice and teacher voice, conceptualized as perspectives and participation, influenced theories of culturally responsive computing and computational thinking in early childhood education and the translation of theory into practice in classroom and home settings. Findings showed that connecting powerful ideas from computational thinking, namely algorithms and problem solving (e.g., debugging), to familiar activities and experiences served as a powerful entry point. Yet, differences arose in how teachers and parents conceptualized culturally relevant computing and made connections to familiar routines. We discuss what can be learned from parent voice in regards to bolstering children's self-expression, access to increasingly complex computational thinking tasks, and opportunities for learning cultural and community values through computing.

AB  - In recent years, the development of computational thinking (CT) has become integral to many school curricula worldwide. This has been associated with calls for computational thinking to be considered a ‘21St Century’ competency, valuable to all students as a transferable process for solving problems and building understanding of human behaviour and systems. However, while computational thinking is a focus of most secondary school computer science curricula, proponents such as Jeanette Wing argue its relevance for younger students, indicating more work must be done investigating its development in early years' education. This study used a structured, problem-based curriculum supported by guided inquiry pedagogy, to explore 6 year old students' learning of basic computational thinking concepts and practices while coding programmable floor robots (Blue-bots and an iPad app). Results indicated improvement across the seven lessons in students' sequencing/algorithm authoring, error correction, and pattern recognition. Furthermore, they revealed evidence of higher order thinking such as identifying patterns in code, and how these can be transferred to help solve problems of different designs. While currently play-based approaches are used to introduce computational thinking concepts and practices in early years' education, results from this study suggest that more structured, problem-based methods should be seriously considered. Results challenge commonly understood developmental theories about what young children can and can't do, contextualised within the field of computer science, and hold implications for early years' teachers' professional knowledge and pedagogy if they are to promote their students' learning in this increasingly important area. Given rapid technological advancements such as artificial intelligence (AI) and increasingly earlier exposure of young children to digitally-mediated information, this study provides support for the earlier and more systematic introduction of basic digital literacy knowledge and skills in early years' education.

In this study, we investigated the robots used, proposed activities, and evaluation processes. We also analyzed research contexts and the stated motivations to conduct the studies. Our review identified characteristics of the robots, such as input and output interfaces, cost, and availability. We also categorized activities considering context, modality of work, type of activities, duration, adults’ role, scaffolding, unplugged activities, explicit debugging, communication and sharing instances, and teaching knowledge from other domains. We analyzed the computational thinking evaluation process looking at types of assessments, asset concepts, and research design. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of existing research, identifies existing gaps, and provides recommendations for future studies.

AB  - The integration of computational thinking (CT) into K-12 education offers substantial potential to improve digital literacy and deepen students’ understanding across various subject areas. By embedding computational procedures and solution-oriented approaches into traditional curricula, students can develop essential skills that are critical for thriving in an increasingly digital world. However, the effective integration of CT into subject-specific learning poses challenges for educators, largely due to a lack of training and experience in implementing interdisciplinary instructional strategies. This study explores the impact of integrating CT into K-12 education through diverse instructional approaches, including modelling, storytelling, and unplugged activities. The research examines how students' subject knowledge, CT concepts, and practices evolved under each CT integration practice, as well as their acceptance toward CT integrated lessons. The study was conducted in different subjects, including language arts, biology, and physics, and at different grade levels. The technology acceptance model was used as a theoretical framework to understand students' adoption towards the different integration practices. The study revealed that different CT integration practices yield varying impacts on students' attitudes, particularly in relation to their prior programming experiences. Namely, primary school students with prior programming experience display a higher behavioural intention due to a lack of early biases toward programming. Conversely, secondary school students, less familiar with interdisciplinary approaches, initially show less enthusiasm for future engagement. These insights underscore the need for tailored instructional strategies that consider students' prior experiences and the broader goal of preparing them to contribute to a technologically driven society.

AB  - As we begin to identify essential skills for the future, there has been an increased focus on how to define and implement computational thinking within education. However, the question of how to engage children with coding activities within the context and limitations of the curriculum remains relatively explored. In our study, a human-centered design approach was followed to guide a small group of children through the co-design, implementation and evaluation of a board game. The board game had two versions: an offline version involving a robotic agent and an online version with its digital equivalent. A mixed-method approach was used to understand and compare levels of engagement, usability, and collaboration in both versions of the game. The tangible aspect of working with a robotic agent in the offline version led to greater levels of motivation and involvement with the game mechanics. Tangible robotics games tend to be more approachable for children. Our study shows that using such games by connecting the mathematics curriculum with coding problems can successfully engage participants in collaborative computational thinking activities. We contribute to the field by providing human-centered guidance for the creation of educational tools to develop computational thinking. Such guidance is not only applicable in technologically rich environments; it can also be applied in educational communities with limited access to technology.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has been relevant in teaching STEM courses, and educators are incorporating both plugged and unplugged CT activities in their modules to prepare new entrants for advanced knowledge. However, additional empirical data are needed to understand how an unplugged activities approach can lead to an improved understanding of CT concepts. Therefore, this study investigates the impact of unplugged activities on novice students' CT skills and unravels the characteristics of students' CT competency from performing unplugged activities. The experimental aspect of this study was conducted with a cohort of 210 students participating in an introductory programming course at a University in Nigeria. A mixed-method research approach and a quasi-experimental design were applied in this study to understand how the unplugged approach in teaching CT could help students improve their CT competency. A paired-sample t-test of familiarity score for each CT concept showed a significant increase in the score before and after the intervention. Furthermore, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was used for topic modeling of the text describing students’ solutions. Topic modeling allows for more insights into the steps taken by the students to solve CT problems. Only 27.62 % of students' solution descriptions contained CT concepts, 56.90 % of the students solved the puzzle with an optimal score, and 72.41 % of students who applied CT concepts of problem abstraction and decomposition were able to solve the puzzle correctly. Indeed, CT unplugged activities significantly increased the number of students who gained CT competency. In addition, this study provides recommendation for computer science educators and highlight future direction.

AB  - Computational thinking is a fundamental competence that is being introduced in K-12 and succeeding curricula worldwide. Despite this huge effort, many computational thinking models in the literature do not explicitly take into consideration the pupils’ age and the developmental nature of computational thinking skills. Furthermore, many existing computational thinking models are focused on the internal thinking processes of the individuals, failing to explicitly consider the situated nature, in terms of social context and artefactual environment, that usually characterise tasks that require computational thinking to be solved. In this paper, we present a framework for the design, realisation, analysis, and assessment of computational thinking activities, called CT-cube. The CT-cube allows to extend existing computational thinking models to consider the life-long development of computational thinking skills in individuals, from childhood to adult age, and to take into consideration the situated nature of computational thinking activities. We use the CT-cube to design an unplugged task, called Cross Array Task (CAT), allowing to assess the algorithmic skills of K-12 pupils and we show how the CT-cube can be used in this case to illustrate the development of this competence along the entire compulsory school path, considering a sample of 109 pupil aged 3 to 16 in Switzerland.

AB  - The current single teaching and assessing modes of English as a foreign language (EFL) grammar in China have caused the disconnect between grammar knowledge and competency with numerous errors in essay writing, somehow ignoring the analysis of learners thinking patterns. To solve the problem, computational thinking (CT), a higher-order thinking in solving problems and optimizing the way to acquire knowledge, was employed in the study. As needed, the experimental group was taught using the CT teaching model following CT principal elements (data analysis, pattern recognition, abstraction, decomposition, and parallelization), while the control group followed the traditional teaching mode. Quantitative and qualitative data were obtained based on the pre-test-post-test, classroom observation, and questionnaire survey. The results show that the grammar application in short essay writing of all the members of the experimental group significantly improved and that higher grammar learning agency and engagement were unfolded to show the changes of thinking patterns. However, not all the members from the control group showed similar results. CT serves as an important social mediation tool in EFL teaching. This study further enriches the teaching modes of grammar and is an effective attempt at introducing CT into learners’ thinking patterns.

AB  - With growing interest in supporting the development of computational thinking (CT) in early childhood, there is also need for new assessments that serve multiple purposes and uses. In particular, there is a need to understand the design of formative assessments that can be used during classroom instruction to provide feedback to teachers and children in real-time. In this paper, we report on an empirical study and advance a new unit of observational analysis for formative assessment that we call an indicator of a knowledge refinement opportunity or as a shorthand, KRO indicators. We put forth a new framework for conceptualizing the design of formative assessments that builds on the Evidence Centered Design framework but centers identification and analysis of indicators of knowledge refinement opportunities. We illustrate a number of key indicators through empirical examples drawn from video recordings of Kindergarten classroom lessons.

AB  - Interest in coding education has exploded in the past five years, especially in elementary and early secondary education. Teachers who are largely new to coding are expected to guide entire student bodies through the fundamentals of coding and computational thinking. But little is known about which coding and computational thinking (CT) concepts teachers feel most comfortable with and which concepts they struggle with. This study describes 127 elementary coding teachers’ changes in their beliefs about teaching coding and CT as they participated in year-long continuous professional development. Novice elementary coding teachers demonstrated most growth in their self-efficacy for teaching sequences, algorithms and loops. They were less secure in their knowledge of conditionals, variables, and functions. For computational thinking, teachers were most confident in their ability to identify patterns, think algorithmically, understand logic, and evaluate outcomes, showing less growth with decomposition and abstraction.

AB  - This study compares the effects of coding education with educational robot and unplugged coding activities on pre-school students' computational thinking and executive function skills. This study used a pre-test and post-test comparison group quasi-experimental design. The study was conducted in a public kindergarten with 48 pre-school students (24 educational robot- BeeBot® group and 24-unplugged coding group) aged 5-6. The TechCheck-K test was used to measure computational thinking skills, and Executive Functions Battery-Computerized Touch was used to measure executive function skills. The process started with pre-test applications and ended with post-tests after four weeks (16 different sessions) of the implementation in both groups. The study found a statistically significant difference between the computational thinking pre-test and post-test scores of pre-school students in both groups in favor of the post-test. It was determined that there was a statistically significant difference in favor of the educational robot group between the post-test scores of computational thinking skills. In addition, when the findings regarding executive functions were evaluated, there was a statistically significant difference between the pre-test and post-test scores of total executive function in favor of the post-test in both groups. However, it was observed that there was no statistically significant difference between the post-test scores of both groups in terms of total executive function skills scores. In addition, when the post-test scores of pre-school students in two groups were evaluated, it was determined that there was no significant difference in computational thinking and executive function skills according to gender. Consequently, it was determined that coding education with an educational robot was more effective for gaining computational thinking skills than unplugged coding activities for pre-school students. However, it was observed that there was no difference between the two groups in terms of the development of executive function skills in pre-school education.

AB  - Since environmental and energy issues and challenges continues to emerge as key global concerns, Green Building Certification Systems are becoming increasingly relevant in the construction industry. In this regard, LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is considered one of the most widely recognized environmental assessment methods used globally in the construction industry today. However, due to the high level of complexity of the LEED system, the tools usually used to verify the achievement of the credits lack of “design friendliness” and hardly communicate effectively with the conventional tools used by architects and engineers (e.g. CAD, BIM). This makes difficult to fully take into account, especially at the early design stage, the many interconnected aspects that contribute to the green certification, with consequent issues often arising in the design validation and/or construction phases, resulting in time delays and cost increments. The application of innovative problem-solving methods, such as computational thinking, together with coding techniques, represents an effective way to deal with this issue. This kind of methodology, in fact, allows the requirements of a specific LEED credit to be digitally parametrised and flexibly incorporated into a “designer friendly” working environment. In particular, Visual Programming Languages (VPLs), due to their high simplicity of usage, allow architects and engineers to develop algorithms and thus implement their technical knowledge in the field of environmental design with computer programming skills, useful to improve their tools and keep them constantly updated. The aim of this paper is to illustrate a methodology through which, by merging computational thinking strategies with VPL tools, is possible to keep under control, in the same working environment, all the parameters required to verify in real time the achievement of LEED credits. To demonstrate the flexibility of the approach, dedicated tools developed for the verification of some specific credits at different scales – neighbourhood and building – are illustrated as operational examples of the proposed methodology.

AB  - Computational thinking, defined by Wing (2011) as the “thought processes involved in formulating problems … so that the solutions are represented in a form that can effectively be carried out by an information-processing agent,” has become the central construct of K12 computing education around the world. This article provides a history of computational thinking, a summary of computational thinking's role in educational policy and practice, role as a research construct, and concludes by considering the future of computational thinking. The debate over how to define and teach computational thinking can be understood as a proxy for the broader questions about education.

AB  - Collecting and organizing data to understand and answer real-world questions is an increasingly important skill in our current world. Fostering data collection and analysis (DCA) skills in young children leverages key mathematics skills as well as the data representation, visualization, and interpretation skills of computational thinking (CT), culminating in a problem-solving approach with data. As such, the intervention, comprising investigations and a digital app, supported preschool teachers and children to answer data-focused questions by engaging in each step of the DCA process in order to foster CT and math skills. Teachers appreciated that the app offers a new way for children to visualize data and noted that the app provided learning opportunities for children that would not otherwise be possible or easy to implement. Results also suggest that the app provides a systematic process for data collection, entry, and interpretation. Children in classrooms that completed the intervention had significantly higher scores at post-intervention compared to children in classrooms that did not complete the intervention, controlling for pre-intervention scores, B(SE) = 0.13(0.05), t (6) = 2.48, p = .048.

AB  - Computational Thinking (CT), the conceptual foundations required for solving complex problems effectively and efficiently, is an imperative skill for today's learners, across disciplines and across ages. As for its importance in the wide network of digital literacies, CT has been implemented in various educational contexts, however mostly via digital artifacts, specifically in programming-related activities. This approach does not fulfill the potential of such integration for promoting learning. In this paper, we argue that digital literacies should not be bound to the digital realm, and present a novel approach to fully integrate CT into learning and teaching by the development of CT-infused “unplugged” pedagogical tools that are fully embedded in the subject matter. We demonstrate the advantages to student learning of these tools in two case studies from K-12 mathematics education: 1) An assistive tool for function investigation in high-school calculus – in this case, we point out to how CT skills that were implemented in the tool promoted students' problem solving; 2) A teaching unit for pattern sequences in elementary school – in this case, we show how students in the CT research group outperformed students in the other groups, and how they implemented CT to solve pattern sequence problems effectively and efficiently. We highlight that besides enhancing learning, this approach can help address the important issue of equity in education, and suggest ways to promote it via dedicated professional development.

AB  - Creativity and Computational Thinking (CT) have been pointed out as two important skills that would promote students in the digital age as contributing members of society. Therefore, these two constructs have been extensively researched in recent years, but the associations between them are yet to be fully understood. This study takes another step towards bridging this gap by examining the association between CT and three types of creativity, i.e., Figural Creative Thinking, Verbal Creative Thinking, and Computational Creativity. Data was collected from 119 ninth-grade students (14–15 years old) from Israel. Students took two commonly used creativity tests (Torrance's Test of Creative Thinking, and the Alternative Uses Test). They also used Kodetu—an online learning environment for CT—and we used the system log files to measure their CT acquirement and their computational creativity. Findings suggest some nuanced associations between the four sets of variables. Specifically, we point out the limited associations between verbal and figural creativities, some of which are negative; also, we found that the associations between creative thinking and CT, as well as between creative thinking and computational creativity, differ by gender.

AB  - Many studies have demonstrated that Virtual Exchange (VE) for teaching languages can have a positive effect on learners' intercultural awareness or achievements. However, during this century, the teaching process has shifted from teaching with technology to solving problems with it. In this regard, pedagogical experts in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) have developed programming and robotics based on Computational Thinking skills (CTs), which have been regarded as the core of 21st-century skills. In the field of CALL, this skill has received very little attention. Accordingly, we have attempted to switch the process and outcome of language learning in VE. Thus, we developed the conceptual framework that integrated CTsCALL and Individual-technology-task-environment Fit (ITTEF). Having designed our VE tasks based on CTsCALL, we provided the opportunity for 92 Spanish language learners in our project to exchange language and culture with Cypriot and Irish students and solve VE tasks based on CTsCALL. The result of the symmetric phase of the study validated the five-dimensional structure of CTsCALL and the four-dimensional structures of ITTEF in VE and CALL. It also revealed that language learners, who focused on the key information rather than the details while solving language tasks, as well as recognizing the pattern of task solving and applying them to other tasks, found VE, and CTsCALL to be aligned with their current capabilities, learning environment, and problem-solving skills that mediated their intention to learn and exchange information in this context in the future. Furthermore, the asymmetrical part of the study revealed that sixteen solutions are available to shape language learners' continued intention to use VE by combining the components of CTsCALL and ITTEF. Thus, the study developed the CTsCALL questionnaire and its theory into CALL together with the Council of Europe's Common European Framework of Reference for Languages and recommended that CALL researchers and educators take a broader view of VE, as well as continuing to validate CTsCALL in other CALL disciplines to show that this skill belongs to CALL as well.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is gaining increasing attention from researchers and practitioners all over the world to empower children in the digital era. However, there is no consensus on which components of CT to teach beginning coders in early childhood education (ECE). To address this issue, we conducted a systematic review of 42 empirical studies focused on teaching and assessing CT in ECE. We analyzed the included studies with the three-dimensional CT framework proposed by Brennan and Resnick (2012) and demonstrated how this framework could be modified to fit the context of ECE. Based on this systematic review, we sorted out the CT components that were proven suitable for young children to learn by incorporating emerging components and removing components inappropriate for young children. We thus proposed a CT curriculum framework for ECE that covers CT concepts (i.e., control flow/structures, representation, and hardware/software), CT practices (i.e., algorithmic design, pattern recognition, abstraction, debugging, decomposition, iteration, and generalizing), and CT perspectives (i.e., expressing and creating, connecting, perseverance, and choices of conduct). This systematic review and its associated CT curriculum framework provide important theoretical contributions and practical implications for early childhood CT education.

AB  - In this paper, we review and meta-analyze the findings of experimental studies published between 2006 and 2022 that examined the effects of coding and programming interventions on children's core and higher order executive functions (response inhibition, working memory, cognitive flexibility, planning and problem solving). The systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to address three research questions: 1) Which executive functions are most impacted by the teaching of CT? 2) Which instructional modality (educational robotics/virtual coding/unplugged coding) is most effective in enhancing executive function skills in learners aged 4–16 years? and 3) Does the cognitive effectiveness of coding vary with children's age? A total of 19 studies with 1523 participants met the selection criteria for the systematic review. The meta-analysis included 11 of those studies. The results reveal beneficial effects of structured virtual and tangible coding (educational robotics) activities for preschoolers and first graders, and significant effects of more unstructured virtual coding activities (e.g., Scratch-based) for older students. A multivariate fixed-effects model meta-analysis shows that the teaching of coding significantly improves problem-solving with the highest effect (dppc2 = 0.89), but also planning (dppc2 = 0.36), and inhibition and working memory with lower effects (dppc2 = 0.17, dppc2 = 0.20).

AB  - In light of the increasing importance digital economy, the significance of computational thinking has grown exponentially, becoming imperative in both workplace and academic settings such as universities. This article addresses the critical need to comprehend the factors influencing the acceptance of computational thinking. The dataset introduces an extensive questionnaire comprising five constructs and 25 items, rooted in the extended Technology Acceptance Model. Notably, the model incorporates facilitating conditions and subjective norm, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding acceptance. Data collection involved 132 undergraduate university students sampled through purposive sampling, specifically targeting courses with a focus on computational thinking. The resulting dataset serves as a valuable resource for future research, offering detailed insights into the factors determining the acceptance of technology in educational contexts beyond mere thinking skills. Given the scarcity of research on technology acceptance in developing nations, this dataset holds particular significance, serving as a foundation for potential cross-cultural comparisons. The dataset contributes to the field by presenting a robust acceptance model, explaining 74.2 per cent of the variance in behavioural intention, 60.2 per cent in perceived usefulness, and 56.1 per cent in perceived ease of use. This high explanatory power positions the dataset as a superior resource for replication, benchmarking, and broader applicability in diverse contexts, thereby enhancing the understanding of computational thinking acceptance across different populations and settings. This dataset stands among the pioneering efforts to assess the novel covariance-based structural equation model algorithm within SmartPLS 4, presenting a valuable resource for future research employing the same mechanism.

AB  - This paper describes a study designed to investigate the promise of resources that support the development of computational thinking (CT) in preschool children. This study was the culmination of a collaborative research process between researchers and media developers of a home-based intervention that included media and hands-on activities created to support the development of young children's CT. The mixed-methods study included 108 families, each with a 4- or 5-year-old child. Families, who participated in the study at home for six weeks, were randomly assigned to an intervention group that viewed media and engaged with hands-on activities with a CT focus or a control group that viewed and engaged with non-STEM literacy content. Data collection consisted of parent surveys, parent interviews, and CT learning and pre-coding tasks to assess children's CT abilities. Results indicate that the learning intervention demonstrates promise in supporting parental understanding of CT. Experience with the intervention over the six weeks also appeared to cultivate some CT strategy use in children as evidenced by parental reports and performance on learning and pre-coding sequencing tasks.

AB  - This study characterizes the literature on teaching computational thinking (CT) to preschoolers aged 4 to 5 years. Previous research and published systematic studies have provided important contributions about CT teaching to elementary and high school children. However, to date, there is no systematic overview of CT education for preschoolers. For this reason, this systematic mapping synthesizes 82 studies on CT teaching, through the implementation and evaluation of tools and activities to teach, improve or measure the CT knowledge acquired by children. Furthermore, studies on courses or training offered to preschool teachers related to the teaching of CT were also considered. From the selected studies, the following information was collected: year of publication; recovery sources and databases; vehicles and places of publication; temporal delimitation of research, research approach, nature and research method; CT teaching approaches; tools used to teach CT and how they are classified according to their physical characteristics and, finally, participants and individuals responsible for the research. The results suggest an increase in the number of publications in recent years, revealing the interest of researchers in the topic. Furthermore, we observed a trend towards the use of physical artifacts and the use of the disconnected computing approach to teaching CT skills to preschool children. The results also exposed that preschool teachers have little autonomy in implementing CT teaching activities because those are mostly implemented by computer professionals (researchers, teachers, etc.). This is because preschool teachers are still discouraged from teaching computer and technology-related content to children, considering them complex and disconnected from basic curricula. However, when teachers are trained to teach CT, they become interested in the content and become more active during the teaching process. We argue for integrating CT-related content into education curricula and supporting preschool teachers to implement it autonomously in their classrooms.

AB  - This paper deals within a context where technology plays a pivotal role in education. In this sense, it is essential to highlight the emergence of new competencies and skills in education due to technological advancements. Legislative frameworks have been developed to incorporate digital literacy, access to robotics, and computational thinking, between others. Hence, this review and meta-analysis aim at identifying the influence of robotics activities on computational thinking through a PRISMA-guided review. The findings reveal that interventions conducted in early childhood education significantly impact computational thinking. Results also showcase that, despite perceived barriers related to technology accessibility, the presence of legislation and contexts prioritizing these competencies is more relevant than the digital access gap.

AB  - Since computational thinking is a high-level cognitive skill and its conceptual framework has not yet been clarified, the assessment of this skill is problematic. While there is no consensus in the literature about the components of computational thinking, the abstraction component is located at a point where opinions intersect. In addition, it is predicted that computer science unplugged activities will improve computational thinking, and there is limited research examining this effect. As a result, this research aims to demonstrate the alleged effects of computer science unplugged activities on abstraction skill which is considered the critical component of computational thinking. The study, which was planned with a mixed methods research design, lasted 8 weeks. Quantitative data were obtained from the abstraction skill test developed by the researchers, while qualitative data were obtained from observations and task- based interviews after each activity. Quantitative findings showed that computer science unplugged activities significantly improve abstraction skills and thus computational thinking. Qualitative findings not only revealed that developments in the six abstracting steps caused this significant difference but also identified abstracting steps where the effect of each activity was limited. Suggestions for organizing activities to improve these steps are given. Finally, suggestions are presented for the conceptual framework of computational thinking based on abstraction.

AB  - The healthy development of cognitive functions, including executive functions, has been shown to depend mainly on the experiences and learning opportunities of people, especially during childhood. Over the past few years, researchers have been studying the impacts of diverse types of interventions on children’s cognitive development in which computational thinking programs are a recent field. This pilot study evaluated the effect of computational thinking training based on the “Programming for Children” program on the executive functions of children aged 10 and 11 years: working memory, inhibition, and planning (N = 30). The results showed that children in the experimental group improved on tests of visuospatial working memory, cognitive inhibition, and sequential planning compared with the control group. However, tests of verbal working memory, memory strategy, and visual spatial planning did not show any observed changes. Although this was an exploratory study, and its findings should be interpreted cautiously due to the small sample size, the findings support the relevance and feasibility of conducting similar larger studies with larger samples.

AB  - Computational thinking has been promoted as an impactful 21st-century skillset that can be transferred to many other disciplines and problem scenarios. With the proliferation of age-appropriate coding platforms for young children, computational thinking has become increasingly popular in early childhood settings. However, there is a lack of research on introducing coding and computational thinking to teacher training in early childhood education. To empower early childhood teachers in the digital society, this study introduced 17 early childhood teachers to robot programming and computational thinking through the ‘CT4ECE’ professional development program, which includes three phases: Learn, Practice, and Reflect & Improve. Results of pre- and post-intervention surveys revealed that the CT4ECE program significantly enhanced teachers' robotics and pedagogical knowledge, as well as their attitudes towards computational thinking, especially their interest in and their view of using computational thinking in classroom practice. Post-intervention interviews indicated that participation in CT4ECE helped educators gain a basic understanding of both coding robots and computational thinking suitable for young children due to a structured change process for teachers' professional learning. This study establishes a strong foundation for enhancing and expanding the CT4ECE program, ultimately equipping teachers and children with the necessary skillsets to thrive in the digital future.

AB  - The purpose of the current study is to investigate the effects of the unplugged computational thinking (CT) integrated STEM (UCT-STEM) approach and STEM approach on early childhood pre-service teachers’ CT skills (creativity, algorithmic thinking, critical thinking, problem solving, cooperativity, communication). The study was conducted with a total of 70 early childhood pre-service teachers. Quasi-experimental design was used; activities based on the UCT-STEM approach were administered to the experimental group and activities based on the STEM approach were administered to the control group. Post-test scores for CT skills showed a statistically significant difference in favour of the experimental group. It was concluded that the UCT-STEM approach was more effective in developing the pre-service teachers’ CT skills than the STEM approach. The current study presents an important finding to the literature in terms of the developed STEM and UCT-STEM contents and how these contents improve pre-service teachers’ CT skills. The STEM and UCT-STEM content provides significant information in terms of teacher practices. At the same time, this study offers important implications for program developers and policy-makers to integrate these innovative educational approaches into both early childhood education and teacher education programs.

AB  - The integration of computational thinking (CT) to enhance creativity in design students has often been underexplored in design education. While design thinking has traditionally been the cornerstone of university design pedagogy and remains essential, the increasing role of digital tools and artificial intelligence in modern design practices presents new opportunities for innovation. By introducing CT alongside design thinking, students can expand their creative toolkit and engage with emerging technologies more effectively. Although many design students may have limited experience with programming, incorporating accessible, no-code tools can help them confidently embrace computational methods, unlocking new pathways for creative exploration and innovation. This study proposes an alternative approach to improve the motivation of design students by introducing machine learning tools into product design processes. We developed an experimental pedagogy in which 56 industrial design university students learned how to use Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (Weka), a machine learning tool, for three hours of design work a week, for a total of eight weeks. Our covariate analysis of data collected in the pretest and posttest shows that the general learning motivations in the group using Weka are significantly higher than those in the group without Weka. However, no significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of learning strategies, collaboration, or critical thinking. Students using Weka spent more time focusing on model training and tended to improve their algorithmic thinking, and the introduction of Weka appeared to enhance their motivation to learn. On the other hand, these students might have been focusing on working individually at their computers, potentially neglecting communication and collaboration. The findings suggest that teaching machine learning applications without requiring coding has the potential to boost design students' motivation to engage with CT skills, though care must be taken to maintain collaborative practices.

AB  - There is increasing effort to integrate Computational Thinking (CT) curricula across all education levels. Therefore, research on CT assessment has lately progressed towards developing and validating reliable CT assessment tools, which are crucial for evaluating students' potential learning progress and thus the effectiveness of suggested curricular programs. Several CT assessment tools were developed for elementary, high-school, and university students over the last years. Moreover, associations between CT scores and other cognitive abilities were unraveled. However, studies on the topic in primary school level are scarce. Like the general concept of intelligence, CT remains broadly defined as the ability to combine algorithmic operations to form complex solutions in order to solve problems effectively, utilizing concepts of computer science with or without the use of computers. In this study, we aimed at specifying a cognitive definition of CT, focusing on the under-investigated population of primary school children. Since validated assessment tools for this age group were not available, we adapted a validated CT test, which was initially designed for middle school students. In our study participated 192 third and fourth graders. The analyses revealed promising results on the reliability of the adapted CT assessment for primary school students. Moreover, findings indicated CT's positive associations with i. complex numerical abilities, ii. verbal reasoning abilities, and iii. non-verbal visuospatial abilities. Our results indicate similarities but also differences in associations of CT with other cognitive abilities in primary school children compared to other age groups. In summary: i. numerical abilities seem to associate with CT at the primary school level, whereas this seems not the case later on in education, ii. verbal abilities seem to associate with CT both along primary and secondary education levels, and iii. non-verbal reasoning abilities seem to associate with CT from primary education level to the university level and beyond. These differences imply that several basic cognitive abilities support CT abilities and CT development differentially across ages.

AB  - The concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI), born as the possibility of simulating the human brain's learning capabilities, quickly evolves into one of the educational technology concepts that provide tools for students to better themselves in a plethora of areas. Unlike the previous educational technology iterations, which are limited to instrumental use for providing platforms to build learning applications, AI has proposed a unique education laboratory by enabling students to explore an instrument that functions as a dynamic system of computational concepts. However, the extent of the implications of AI adaptation in modern education is yet to be explored. Motivated to fill the literature gap and to consider the emerging significance of AI in education, this paper aims to analyze the possible intertwined relationship between students’ intrinsic motivation for learning Artificial Intelligence during the COVID-19 pandemic; the relationship between students’ computational thinking and understanding of AI concepts; and the underlying dynamic relation, if existing, between AI and computational thinking building efforts. To investigate the mentioned relationships, the present empirical study employs mediation analysis based upon collected 137 survey data from Universidad Politécnica de Madrid students in the Institute for Educational Science and the School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering during the first quarter of 2022. Findings show that intrinsic motivation mediates the relationship between perceived Artificial Intelligence learning and computational thinking. Also, the research indicates that intrinsic motivation has a significant relationship with computational thinking and perceived Artificial Intelligence learning.

AB  - Computational thinking is widely recognized as an essential skill for adapting to the current era, with programming learning being the most effective means to develop it. It is recommended that computational thinking and learning programming be introduced as early as elementary school. However, elementary school students often possess limited prior knowledge of programming, posing challenges in their learning process. The graphic organizers (GOs) may serve as a bridge between students’ existing knowledge and new learning, facilitating a deeper processing of the overall information and thereby enhancing the learning process. This can be particularly advantageous for early-stage learners when grappling with difficult subjects. Consequently, this study employed GOs to assist elementary school students in their computational thinking and programming learning, employing a quasi-experiment design to evaluate their effectiveness. The results showed that although all students demonstrated awareness of applying computational thinking to solve problems, those exposed to GO-based instruction exhibited higher levels of computational thinking, programming skills, and flow experiences.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) practices is a critical cognitive tool for students to overcome challenges in this technological era. Few studies investigated CT practices from a development perspective. A two-year intervention was implemented in 30 intervention and 22 control schools in Hong Kong to promote CT education (T1baseline: N = 13,056; T2: N = 16,367; and T3: N = 15,269). Senior primary students (grades 4 to 6) around 8–12 years old were targeted. Among them, 34% were girls at T1baseline. Their learning progression of cognitive development was assessed with a CT practices test. Data were analyzed using item response analysis. Learning trajectories of CT practices were modeled to understand how students’ cognitive development differed between schools. Insights of findings were discussed in bringing CT practices to life.

AB  - Engagement is critical to computational thinking and programming education. However, as multi-dimensional variables, when analyzing how different aspects of engagement in computational thinking tasks influence skills development, it becomes crucial to discern precisely which engagement components intersect with the progression of computational thinking skills. This discernment is pivotal because engagement can vary based on the task nature, the context, and the individual's preferences. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the gender differences in engagement and computational thinking skills and the predictive relationships among these sub-dimensions for boys and girls in an unplugged environment. In this study, a quasi-experiment for 90 sixth-grade students from a north Chinese primary school was performed. By partial least squares–structural equation modeling, students’ models of computational thinking skills and engagement were analyzed, and comparisons of boys and girls were made by analysis of covariance statistics. Results indicated that compared with boys, girls reported higher computational thinking performance and more engagement in unplugged contexts. Furthermore, girls’ computational thinking skills were only predicted by their cognitive engagement, whereas boys’ computational thinking skills were predicted by their behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement. Teachers can adopt these findings to design computational thinking teaching interventions that combine the advantages of unplugged activity and focus on the engagement of boys and girls.

AB  - In this work, we argue for expanding the scope of K-12 computational thinking (CT) integration contexts to include everyday scenarios involving moral reasoning. Epistemic overlap between computational thinking practices and moral reasoning suggest that these contexts are potentially rich sites to see “seeds of CT” in children's reasoning and can provide rich educational pathways for children into CT. Taking a case-study approach, we examine the reasoning of a second-grader, Ollie, on a task involving fair allocation of resources to victims of a natural disaster. Our analysis finds that Ollie's reasoning was rich with seeds of CT (e.g., problem formulation, abstraction, complex-systems thinking) and that empathy served as an important supporting role to the CT. This work has implications for curricular design, suggesting that fairness and resource allocation scenarios with built-in opportunities for empathy might provide rich sandboxes for CT integration.

AB  - Although there are different definitions for computational thinking in the literature, it is possible to define it mainly as problem solving, designing and interpreting new systems by thinking like a computer. According to Wing (2006), computational thinking is a way of designing a system and understanding human behaviors by focusing on the basic concepts of the computer sciences. The recent focus on computational thinking as a key 21 st century skill for all students has led to a number of curriculum initiatives to embed it in K-12 classrooms and to introduce computing ideas to students early during their schooling years. The present study aims to explore the effects of a short, intensive coding and robotics training on the computational thinking skill self-efficacy of middle school students. 24 fifth graders participated in the study and data were collected by means of the Computational Thinking Self-efficacy scale (CTS) and one open-ended question. Analyses of the pre, post and delayed tests revealed significant differences between the pre and post-tests.

The benefits of utilizing the Design-Based Implementation Research (DBIR) approach in public libraries to resolve a persistent problem of practice, a lack of assessment tools to evaluate youth Computational Thinking (CT) programs, is demonstrated. Findings from a three-year, three-phased study utilizing the DBIR approach to design and implement a suite of assessment tools to assess CT programming in public libraries are presented. Guided by the four principles of the DBIR approach, this research produced new knowledge, including identifying CT program outcomes, challenges, and recommendations for designing and implementing assessment tools to measure the impact of public libraries' CT programming. Findings underscore the DBIR approach as a strategy for engaging with practitioners and helping shift their perspectives by resolving practice problems and facilitating the design of sustainable solutions.

AB  - Although there is controversy surrounding rewards and competition in education, they are key elements in digital game-based learning (DGBL). Research on the influence of rewards and competition in DGBL often yields mixed results, suggesting a need to investigate individual game elements and their interactions. This study implemented DGBL focusing on computational thinking (CT) in 7th-grade classes. Both quantitative and behavioral data were collected to understand the impact of rewards (power-up or customization) and competition (with or without) on students’ intrinsic motivation, game performance, behaviors, and CT skills. The findings uncovered significant interactions between rewards and competition. Students with both competition and power-up rewards achieved the highest game points but the lowest CT performance, whereas those exposed to the same power-up rewards without competition attained the lowest game points but the best CT performance. Implications are drawn for DGBL research and practice.

AB  - Despite growing interest in early childhood computational thinking (CT), there is a lack of validated assessments for children who are emerging readers. This paper presents validity and reliability evidence of a performance-based assessment of CT using item response theory (IRT) from 272 children aged 4–8. Using a two-parameter logistic model IRT model (2PL IRT), we confirmed that model- and item-level fits are acceptable. Item analyses revealed a high discriminability (M = 2.26, SD = 1.12) and a moderate item difficulty (M = −0.21; SD = 0.86), on average, across 19 items. Reliability analysis demonstrated that the assessment was substantially reliable (marginal reliability: rxx = 0.87). Differential item functioning (DIF) analyses indicated that the assessment estimated children's item parameters fairly, regardless of their gender and age. However, we confirmed gaps in latent ability (θ) of CT by gender and age: boys showed higher latent ability of CT than girls, and old children (above 72 months) showed higher latent ability than young children (below 72 months). Findings suggest the assessment is a fair measure that can serve as a reliable and valid tool to assess CT for children who are emerging readers.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is an important and essential skill for human beings to master in the 21st century. Although CT has received wide attention since this concept was proposed, the current theoretical models have not well defined the complex relations between CT and other cognitive abilities for young children. To provide insight into this gap, the current study proposed a model in which we hypothesized that CT was significantly related to arithmetic fluency that is viewed as an important domain of mathematics. Additionally, arithmetic fluency was predicted to mediate the relations of CT to other cognitive abilities, including reasoning and creativity. This study tested such direct and indirect relations in children aged 5–6 years. Consistent with previous studies on older age groups, the results showed that CT and arithmetic fluency were significantly related to each other and both were significantly related to reasoning ability and creative thinking as well. Moreover, this study, for the first time, indicated that arithmetic fluency totally mediated the relation between CT and reasoning ability, suggesting that these concepts share conceptual commonalities, such as the cognitive processes related to mathematics or/and abstraction; in contrast, arithmetic fluency did not mediate the relation between CT and creative thinking, suggesting that gaining CT skill may exert direct positive effect on the development of creativity. Therefore, despite the root in computer science, CT is associated with many cognitive and learning abilities in other domains, supporting the importance of including CT into early school education.

This paper reports on the measurement of implicit CT practices demonstrated by upper elementary- and middle-school students as they play the CT learning game Zoombinis. The process of using the gameplay log data to build valid automated detectors of students' implicit CT practices is discussed. Findings from this study provide implications for analyzing gameplay behaviors at scale, leading to the development of models for the assessment of implicit STEM learning.

We report on the design, evaluation, and outcomes of the Computational Thinking Unplugged for Science (CT-UP-S) professional development program for inservice science teachers. Our process-based approach to CT significantly improved teachers CT understanding and CT/science integration self-efficacy by systematically linking CT practices to scaffold the generation of unplugged algorithms. Additionally, we found that the process-based approach provided a framework for teachers' lesson planning and that teachers’ content knowledge moderated their ability to write CT-integrated science lessons.

AB  - Early evidence suggests that robot programming offers an important foundation for spatial reasoning and computational thinking; however, researchers have debated how to introduce young children to these skills. We explored how preschoolers develop understanding of spatial concepts and computational thinking as the children took turns navigating a path during guided play with a programmable robot. Our analysis of the data included a multimodal visualization of the exchanges between the teacher, children, and a programmable robotic device. The findings highlight the effects that arose from the physical-digital convergence of technology integrated into play including: (a) the robot evoked a chain of actions, enacting pedagogic forces that transformed children's learning; (b) children used their own bodies as spatial referents, co-locating themselves in space with the robot; (c) the teacher remained a key actor, providing verbal and nonverbal scaffolding to promote children's understanding and mastery of spatial and computational concepts; and (d) talking with the teacher about spatial concepts combined with the interactions with the robot enhanced children's acquisition of spatial ideas relative to the quantity of children's verbal expressions and complexity of their applied spatial skills and computational thinking.

AB  - Workers in the areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics play a significant role in the sustained growth and stability of the global economy, and, thus constitute a critical component in helping all countries worldwide to prosper. In this context, computational thinking constitutes an important skill to have as it enables workers to develop creative solutions to complex problems. Nonetheless, across all economies worldwide, there is a need to have more workers who are able to think through problems, challenges, and solutions in computational terms. It is thus of utmost importance to integrate the teaching of computational thinking in K-12 education in order to reduce the skills gap between education and the workplace. A pertinent and crucial question that arises is whether teachers have the knowledge and skills to teach students how to think computationally. Existing research shows that teacher education departments do not currently have the knowledge to promote computational thinking in their programs. The present study focuses on two aspects of computational thinking, such as, algorithmic thinking and debugging skills with the use of scaffolded programming scripts in an educational technology undergraduate course. The results show statistically significant learning gains in pre-service teachers’ algorithmic thinking and debugging skills in the context of robotic programming activities with LEGO WeDo. Limitations and future research directions are discussed.

AB  - Recent studies identify Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) as a key factor in enhancing cognitive development, particularly within Computational Thinking (CT) literature. However, research gaps remain in understanding how SRL and CT interact from a developmental perspective. Our study designed a program with tailored animations and worksheets to specifically foster students' learning and cognitive development. Using a mixed-methods approach, we administered surveys among 1235 students from 29 Hong Kong primary schools to investigate a dynamic learning system comprising SRL and CT in a large-scale CT program. Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 students to further probe insights. Quantitative findings revealed a mutually reinforcing relationship in the dynamic system, suggesting that higher SRL skills enhance cognitive CT abilities, and vice versa. Complementing these results, qualitative findings showed that integrating animations and worksheets into the CT program significantly boosted students' SRL and cognitive development. These findings have significant implications for educational practices and curriculum design. Schools should consider implementing SRL strategies, such as proactive goal setting and reflective evaluation, within their curricula to promote students’ cognitive development. Furthermore, strategic investments in educational technology, including collaborations with EdTech developers, are essential to create effective, pedagogically sound tools that enhance learning outcomes. These insights provide valuable guidance for creating a supportive SRL environment that fosters cognitive development in primary school education.

AB  - In recent years, there has been increasing interest in integrating Computational Thinking (CT) into elementary schools. However, few studies have focused on teachers’ perceptions. This study aims to examine teachers' perceptions to bridge the gap between theory and practice. The study analysed teachers’ perceptions of integrating CT into school subjects through the constructionist approach, using Scratch a leading programming platform inspired by Resnick's Lifelong Kindergarten Constructionist model. Over a school year, 31 teachers participated in a professional development program and applied this model in their classrooms. The teachers were interviewed to capture their perceptions of learning and teaching using a constructionist method. The findings revealed that teachers with creative arts experience fully embraced the model, while others partially adopted it. Teachers recognized the benefits of constructionist teaching in fostering creativity, motivation, and engagement among students. However, they struggled with balancing these benefits with school demands and constraints. Challenges included managing time effectively within constraints of school and ensuring curriculum alignment. Despite this, many teachers found that the constructionist approach positively impacted students' learning engagement and personal development. By addressing the identified challenges, teacher education designers, curriculum developers, and schools can develop practices for closing the gap between theory and practice.

AB  - Educational research on predicting learners’ computer programming performance has yielded practical implications that guide task designs in computer education. There have been attempts to investigate learners’ computer programming patterns using high-frequency and automated data collection. This approach can be considered as process-based analysis as opposed to outcome-based analysis (i.e., the use of test or exam scores). In this process-based approach to investigate learners’ computer programming process, we included two critical constructs in our research, self-regulated learning and computational thinking skills. We aimed to identify learners’ computer programming patterns in the context that novice students learn a computer programming language, Python, in an online coding environment. We examined the relationships between the learners’ coding patterns, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills. Initially, we adopted a traditional approach with the aggregate data of learners’ computer programming behaviors. We then utilized a computational analytics approach to learner performance, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills, with ever-changing computer programming patterns. In our initial approach, the indicators of aggregate computer programming data were not associated with learners' learning performance and computational thinking skills. In the computational analysis approach, many indicators revealed significant differences between the identified patterns regarding computational thinking skills and self-regulated learning. Recommendations about the use of programming log data analysis methods and future scaffolding for computer programming learners are addressed.

AB  - In the field of education, research has consistently emphasized mathematical creative thinking as a crucial component of 21st-century skills. Thus, this cross-sectional study examines the predictors of such thinking by specifically focusing on the roles of perceived creativity, creative self-efficacy, and computational thinking. The participants consisted of 896 secondary school students (52.9 % female; 47.1 % male) in Indonesia who were asked to complete a series of online questionnaires and tests. For analysis, structural equation modeling was employed, demonstrating satisfactory construct validity and instrument reliability. Based on the results, there was a positive association between computational thinking and mathematical creative thinking. In addition, perceived creativity had a positive impact on mathematical creative thinking, whereas creative self-efficacy showed a negative association. As for the empirical model, it revealed that computational thinking plays a mediating role, connecting perceived creativity and creative self-efficacy to mathematical creative thinking. The findings suggest that incorporating these skills and related variables into the mathematics curriculums in schools is essential for preparing students for success in the 21st century.

AB  - Previous studies have explored the relationship between computational thinking (CT) and creativity. However, a consensus has yet to be reached since both CT and creativity varied in ideation and assessment. To uncover the cognitive mechanism underlying the interplay between CT and creativity, we conduct a scoping review of 26 empirical studies published in 2006–2024. Our findings suggested that the effects of working memory varied in the interplay between CT and creativity due to differences in age range, neural network activation regions, and measurements. Intellectual abilities, including algorithmic fluency, reasoning ability, and coding ability, showed cognitive transfer effect on CT skills but not necessarily on creativity, suggesting that cognitive abilities embracing more intelligent elements may contribute to the functional connectivity in CT neural networks but only partly overlapped with creativity involved networks. Although executive functions (working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control) play a crucial role in both CT and creativity, their contributions to the CT-creativity interplay are still rarely studied. Future research should explore the CT-creativity relationship from the perspective of neuroscience.

Sixty-six papers were selected for this systematic review and analyzed for patterns in relation to the implementation of CS education in K-12 schools and its impact on the development of students’ CT skills. Although educational interventions have not always been successful in CS education, this review provides strong evidence that overall, CS education promotes the development of students’ CT in the K-12 setting while improving their creative and critical thinking skills. We recommend early access to CS education, various innovative instructional approaches to CS education and appropriate support and guidance for student learning.

AB  - Recently, the development of computational thinking (CT) skills has become widespread in the whole world. There is a consensus to develop students’ CT skills through unplugged and plugged-in programming. However, the choice of programming approaches taught in schools is arbitrary and few studies have compared the effectiveness differences between unplugged and plugged-in programming. This study aimed to explore the differences between unplugged and plugged-in programming in developing CT skills of students in Grades 1-2 students. It also explored the joint effects of students’ gender, programming experience, programming interest, and programming confidence with different programming approaches on CT skills. The quasi-experimental research approach was used to conduct 10 weeks of unplugged, plugged-in, and regular programming activities with 124 Grades 1-2 students. The results found that unplugged programming promoted CT skills more in the early primary grades than plugged-in programming. We found that boys and students with programming experience in unplugged group performed significantly better in CT skills than in plugged-in group. Moreover, the improvement of CT skills of students in unplugged group was positively correlated with the level of their programming interest and programming confidence. However, these were not observed in plugged-in group. The results of this study can provide precise guidance for teaching CT skills to early primary school students and provide references for CT education.

AB  - This paper presents an investigation that compares and analyzes the interactions of three groups of pre-and-primary school children with three different storytelling systems. We identify emerging patterns through which they engaged in what we refer to as narrative computational thinking. The latter describes broadened aspects of narrative literacy practices that are linked to computational thinking. By applying a multicase study approach and through various vignettes, we illustrate how children applied computational thinking to understand and influence the narrative possibilities offered by the different tools. Our results illustrate circumstances under which digital storytelling activities provide a favorable basis for narrative computational thinking, and that when computational thinking functions as a scaffold for story creation, it encourages a blend of creativity and computational thinking, providing a compelling approach to introducing emerging digital literacies to young children in a narrative context.

AB  - In this study, it is aimed to identify the computational thinking skills used by gifted and talented students in integrated STEM activities based on the EDP. The case study design, a qualitative research method, is employed in the study. The participants consist of gifted and talented students attending the Science and Arts Center. Integrated STEM activities based on the EDP were conducted over the course of ten weeks and among these activities, robotic and 3D modeling-based robot construction activities using Lego sets are addressed in the present study. The STEM activity booklet, researchers' fieldnotes, and teaching process video recordings were used as data collection tools in the study. Data that was collected was analyzed through content analysis. It was seen that gifted and talented students participating in integrated STEM activities based on the EDP make active use of critical thinking skills while providing explanations, making associations, questioning information, giving justifications, solving problems, thinking creatively, making generalizations, and attempting to convince others; as for the instances of defining problems, creating solutions, and evaluating the effectiveness of the solution, the students were observed to actively use their problem-solving skills. The detailed account provided by the study on the way robotic and 3D robot modeling activities improve the computational thinking skills of gifted and talented students contributes to the required educational support and to the existing body of literature.

AB  - In the artificial intelligence age, cultivating young children's computational thinking (CT) has sparked tremendous attention. Programmable robotics is a developmental-appropriate and screen-free means that provides young children with great opportunities to learn programming and develop CT. However, it is reported that young children might have difficulties learning abstract CT concepts. As a helpful pedagogical facilitator, metaphors can help turn abstract concepts into more concrete and clear concepts that learners are familiar with. Therefore, this research proposed a metaphor-based robot programming (MRP) approach and explored its impact on young children's CT and behavioral patterns. A total of 118 children aged 5–6 were recruited in this experiment with two conditions: the experimental group adopted the metaphor-based robot programming (MRP) approach while the control group used the conventional robot programming (CRP) approach. Results revealed that children who adopted the MRP approach outperformed children who adopted the CRP approach on CT. In addition, behavioral analysis indicated that the proposed MRP approach could facilitate children's superior learning performance and more positive learning behaviors, so as to help them achieve learning objectives. Accordingly, this study can provide insightful guidance and inspiration for future research on effective programming teaching and CT development for young children.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is a necessary skill for students. It is as important as the other essential skills such as reading, writing, and arithmetic. However, how to improve students’ CT in robotics is still to be explored. Hence, this study examined the effects of computer supported project-based learning (CSPBL) on students’ CT and learning engagement through comparing students’ CT and engagement in two courses instructed by the same instructor (one instructed with a traditional method, the other instructed with CSPBL). Participants were seventy-nine students from a university in China. Questionnaires, interviews, and project analysis were used to measure students’ CT and learning engagement. The comparative results of self-reports and final projects indicated that the CSPBL enhanced students’ CT. The simulation project training based on the SenseStudy learning platform in CSPBL helped students debug the programming code, optimize the algorithm design, and improve their algorithmic thinking, cooperation, and problem solving during the program error correction. The CSPBL also improved students’ engagement in learning, especially for those with more than one year of programming experience. It was found that the CSPBL was effective in terms of improving students’ CT and engagement in robotics learning. This study provides teachers with practical suggestions to conduct effective robotics instruction.

AB  - Malaysia has introduced computational thinking skills as part of a curriculum integration update to meet the global trends in 21st-century education, focusing on empowering digital literacy. Nevertheless, a preliminary investigation revealed an apparent lack of understanding of computational thinking skills in general among teachers. The study explores the feasibility of developing a localized E-learning system to train computational thinking skills among teachers. An E-learning system, termed as myCTGWBL, was developed on the basis of a newly proposed conceptual framework to present computational thinking teaching–learning repertoire to the teachers. The hypothesis is that myCTGWBL would develop teachers' computational thinking and its position in teaching–learning understanding. myCTGWBL relevance was tested through DeLone and McLean's information system and Urbach's collaboration quality construct. To determine the success factors, partial least squares structural equation modeling was used. A total of 369 teachers participated in a two-stage survey. Participants' understanding of computational thinking and perceptions were recorded at the pre- and post-intervention phases. Open-ended questions of the surveys were analyzed using a simple text analysis technique. The closed-ended questions surveys were analyzed using SPSS Statistics 22.0. A significant improvement in teachers' computational thinking teaching–learning repertoire in a relatively short period has been recorded. Teachers also demonstrated increased confidence in the future delivering computational thinking-based lessons. The E-learning conceptual framework has illustrated the predictive power between user intent, user satisfaction, and Computational thinking (CT) knowledge benefits. Results demonstrate that myCTGWBL could be used to guide future planning when establishing CT knowledge acquisition initiatives, particularly among teachers.

AB  - Efforts to incorporate computational thinking (CT) into academic courses have been gaining popularity. CT is a problem-solving skill that is crucial in the 21st century. CT may be used to support language education. Courses in English as a foreign language often need an effective writing component that includes writing organization and language use, as demonstrated by the poor writing samples often generated by students of these courses. To address the problems, CT, which is a higher-order mode of problem-solving and knowledge acquisition optimization, was used. The experimental group was instructed using the CT teaching model based on CT's essential components (decomposition, generalization, abstraction, algorithm, and evaluation), whereas the control group was taught using the conventional method. In total, 58 undergraduate students divided into two groups participated in this study. A combination of writing, CT skills, surveys, and interviews were used to collect data according to an experimental design. The collected quantitative data were analyzed through analysis of covariance and structural equation modeling, and the MAXQDA 2022software was used to analyze the collected qualitative data. The results of this study indicate that incorporating CT into an English writing course enhances the writing and higher-order thinking skills of students. The CT concepts helps students develop critical thinking skills by evaluating the text and identifying potential issues or improvements. Additionally, it allows students to use their skills to create unique writing solutions, which can boost English writing creativity.

AB  - Computational thinking education has become an increasingly popular topic among practitioners and researchers. However, rare is known how to effectively teach and learn computational thinking in early childhood education. To address this knowledge gap, this systematic review examined 26 studies on the teaching and learning of computational thinking in early childhood education from 2010 to 2022. The content knowledge, tools, pedagogical design, assessment methods, and learning outcomes were analyzed. Results indicated that, with age-appropriate instructional design, children could develop early concepts and skills of computational thinking, as well as other related skills such as communication, collaboration, and problem solving. Across the studies, we found that most studies used quantitative research methods, with direct assessment and observation being the most. Several challenges were identified: (1) achieving a deeper learning of computational thinking; (2) a lack of valid and reliable computational thinking assessments for children with a wider age range; (3) selecting appropriate learning tools; and (4) designing age-appropriate activities for young learners. Although with these challenges, computational thinking education could bring new learning opportunities and enhance children's computational thinking skills, as well as other non-cognitive skills such as critical thinking, body-material interaction, and hand-eye coordination.

AB  - Teacher competencies encompass the dimensions of knowledge and attitudes, yet few studies have analysed teachers' latent profiles in relation to the interaction between these two dimensions. Latent profile analysis, which examines the interplay between variables to distinguish subgroups of individuals, has recently emerged in studies of computational thinking (CT) as a method for identifying student profiles. However, the latent profiles of CT teachers have not yet been analysed. We therefore analysed the latent profiles of a sample of 493 teachers who had participated in a teacher development programme in CT, according to their knowledge and perceived usefulness of CT. Three profiles were identified: (1) highly knowledgeable with high perceived usefulness, (2) knowledgeable with low perceived usefulness, and (3) less knowledgeable with low perceived usefulness. Qualitative data further triangulated these findings. We also examined the learning achievement of 12,105 students taught by these teachers. Students taught by highly knowledgeable teachers with a high perceived sense of usefulness demonstrated significantly better achievement than their peers. Our findings highlight the importance of nurturing both knowledge of and perceived usefulness in CT. They also provide valuable insights for similar teacher development programmes, emphasizing the importance of peer mentoring support for less knowledgeable teachers. Additionally, we underscore the value of having teachers create artefacts using CT for instructional purposes, allowing them to gain firsthand experience of its usefulness. As few studies have explored teachers' latent profiles based on the dimensions of knowledge and attitudes, the contribution of this study extends beyond the domain of CT.

AB  - We designed a controlled trial protocol that seeks to contribute to cognitive science by studying the effect of thought training on children's executive functions. The study design is a cluster randomized controlled trial, with intra-subject and inter-subject evaluation, with two parallel groups: an experimental group and a TAU control group. With three measures, pre-test, post-test, and follow-up after three months. The participants will be children aged 9 to 11. The allocation will be randomized by groups and not individually. The sample will be a minimum of 44 participants. The primary measures will be neuropsychological tests to assess executive functions. Secondary measures will be a computational thinking test, neuropsychological tests to assess metacognition and attention, and an acceptability scale. The experimental group will participate in the COGNI-MACHINE computational thinking training designed by the first author. The training frequency will be twice a week in 60 min sessions for 12 weeks. The TAU control group will receive computer science classes as usual during the same time as the experimental group. The evaluators taking the measurements will be blinded to the assignment. The investigators in charge of the intervention will be blinded to the results of the evaluations.

AB  - Negative feedback can temporarily relieve negative Chinese transfer (NCT) in English as a foreign language (EFL) syntactic writing by focusing only on the surface writing constructs, neglecting that EFL writing is an embodiment of the process by which higher-order thinking operates. To solve the problem, the researchers conducted a pretest, interventionist group dynamic assessment (IGDA) in the form of negative feedback based on computational thinking (CT), higher-order thinking, and post-test quasi-experimental design, with a control group receiving the direct correction feedback instructing model to mitigate the NCT in EFL syntactic writing. We analyzed the syntactic writing types and frequencies of the NCT obtained through repeated-measure ANOVA and confirmed by qualitative data through video recording. The results indicated that IGDA in the form of negative feedback based on CT principal skills could (1) significantly decrease syntactic writing errors caused by the NCT, (2) improve learners’ EFL writing performance, and finally, (3) elevate the computer as an essential mediation tool. This innovative instructing mode of intervening with writing constructs and higher-order thinking and bringing about deeper thinking and creativity contributes to the EFL writing teaching methodology in a foreign language higher education.

AB  - The tenure system in the United States places significant importance on teaching effectiveness. To date, students' evaluations of teaching (SETs) have been the reigning mechanism for assessing effective teaching. However, prior work has shown that SETs are often biased against underrepresented groups and minorities. The present study analyzes options for effective teaching assessments, which include evaluating final grades and measuring the differences between students’ pre- and post-tests (normalized gain) using standard instruments. The content area and the instrument used in this study originated in the computational thinking field, which has a widespread presence in engineering, where minorities are at a disadvantage. This study obtained a total of 88 student participants from four sections of an introductory engineering course at a Southwestern institution. The study utilized a computational thinking diagnostic (CTD) to inform the course teaching approach (the intervention). Results show that (a) normalized learning gains correlated moderately with SETs, (b) final grades correlated strongly with SETs, (c) final grades correlated strongly with normalized learning gains, (d) the educational intervention based on the CTD significantly affected student learning, and (e) SET comments affect evaluations. The implications include the notion that standardized instrument-driven instruction and evaluations can increase the success of minorities on both sides of the classroom. The purpose of this manuscript is to invite the Heliyon readership to get involved in the development of related instruments and to incorporate these measures of learning into their instruction so biases are avoided or minimized.

AB  - In the digital age, our lives become more dependent on technology, yet the digital gap is intensifying especially because most people lack digital literacy. As a modest step to handle this challenge, we designed a course named "Play with me in Code" to develop pre-service teachers' (PSTs) thinking skills and expose them to learning by creation using computational thinking and programming as part of the constructionism paradigm. The added value of using Scratch in the context of teacher education lies not only in familiarity with a programming language but with an emphasis on experiencing self-directed learning tackling with problem solving situations, creativity, socioemotional competencies, and logical computational thinking. The present study aims to examine 25 PSTs' attitudes towards facing challenges of coding with Scratch. To this end, a mixed-method approach was activated by using questionnaires, blog posts, and reflections. Findings revealed that the learning environment encouraged PSTs' use of abstraction and decomposition to address a complex problem or to design a complex game. Study's conclusions relate to the importance of providing PSTs opportunities to experience learning by programming for raising their awareness of the importance of enhancing thinking skills and creativity in the future.

AB  - Using the analytical tool CiteSpace, this review study conducted a bibliometric analysis of the characteristics of 249 studies on Computational Thinking (CT) indexed in the Web of Science from 2012 to 2021. The multi-dimensional analytical approach provided a holistic view of the scope of CT research and its progression,and enabled the major topics, themes, disciplinary domains, and prominent authors, institutes, countries/regions, and papers to be identified. Based on the general descriptive data analysis, the results showed that CT has gained increasing influence as a field of research over the past decade. A clustering analysis of the retrieved keywords showed that the development of CT in K-12 education was the most frequently discussed topic. The co-occurrence knowledge maps identified the 11 main research themes and their progress. The research was from a wide spectrum of disciplines including education, science education, computer science, interdisciplinary application, psychology, engineering, and information systems. The highest co-citations were found in the journals of Communication of the ACM, Computers and Education, and Computers in Human Behaviors. The researchers, institutes, and countries/regions that have made the most significant contributions to CT research and the 10 most highly cited CT studies were also identified. Overall, the findings of this review study indicate the paths for future research on developing CT in the classroom.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT), a way to think about solving problems, is recognized as a basic skill for the 21st century. Although game-based learning (GBL) has been shown to improve student's CT skills, students may fail to self-evaluate or debate as they play games, thus failing to develop higher-order thinking. Also not widely explored is how teachers are to practice the CT core competencies during the learning process to cultivate students' problem-solving thinking. As the adoption of student-generated questions (SGQ) is an instructional strategy to promote higher-order thinking, we develop a GBL platform that uses this strategy to enhance students' CT skills, learning motivation, and learning confidence. For this purpose, fifty-three primary school students were recruited for this study, and data were collected during four classes of experimental CT activities. This study shows that the experimental group using the SGQ strategy with a GBL platform exhibited significantly higher CT skills than the control group. In addition, with respect to learning motivation and learning confidence it is found that the experimental group also outperformed the control group. This confirms that integrating the SGQ strategy and CT core competencies fosters higher-order cognitive thinking in students in problem-solving through gamification of the learning environment, resulting in higher motivation and confidence to complete experimental activities.

In this paper, we describe our (1) integrated STEM and computational thinking (CT) teacher preparation program; (2) response to barriers educators face in preparing students to critically use computing principles; and (3) examples of the pedagogical practices teacher candidates developed through the program. We contribute an approach to preparing and empowering educators to support students understanding and use of CT as a lens for advocating for social justice in their lives.

AB  - To effectively utilize artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies such as ChatGPT and realize their novel ethical issues, individuals must have a variety of knowledge and skills about AI. Such knowledge and skills have led to the emergence of AI literacy. Despite the importance of AI literacy in everyday life, little is known about its determinants. To better understand the determinants of AI literacy, we attempted to build a research model relying on previous research and different theoretical frameworks. The model incorporated digital divide, cognitive absorption, and computational thinking. As a major finding from the current study, computational thinking was found to be a significant determinant of AI literacy, which facilitate using, recognizing, and evaluating AI-based technologies. Moreover, we found out that individuals with physical access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) are more expected to use and recognize AI. Also, motivation and skills in using ICTs enable individuals to better evaluate the outcomes of AI-based technologies. The findings also showed that convenient access to ICTs contributes to a deep involvement with AI-based technologies in the use. Further, individuals with higher motivation and skills to use AI technologies are likely to have a pleasant experience after using these technologies.

AB  - Both computational thinking (CT) and creativity have been recognized as key skills for today's learners. Over the last decade, research of both skills in a single context has emerged. In this paper, we present a scoping review of 62 such empirical from 2011 to 2020. Our goal was to have a thorough understanding of the educational settings in which research on both CT and creativity was conducted, the theoretical foundations it has laid down, and the research tools used. Our findings indicate a geographical bias (dominance of the US and prominence of developed European countries), as well as a focus on secondary education and on STEM-related disciplines; this could be explained by the current situation of CT spread. We also found that when studying CT and creativity jointly, it is most common to define CT in a broader perspective than merely programming of computer science. Additionally, while creativity is largely referred to as product-related, CT is barely referred to as such. Taken together, our findings point out some gaps in the current research of CT and creativity and suggest how it should be expended on the fertile grounds of creativity, as the latter crosses geographical, age, and subject borders. Doing so may build a bridge between CT and creativity in a way that will benefit both.

AB  - This paper sheds light on 3–5-year-old children’s enactments of computational empowerment (CE) in activities with computational thinking (CT). CT is widely elaborated on as a universal problem-solving approach and a skill set necessary for thriving in today’s digitized societies. Scholars claim that CT for all should be ensured from an early age, and several studies develop and examine age-appropriate technological tools, as well as pedagogical approaches, for young children’s learning of CT. Based on 1.5 years of co-designing for children’s situated CT in two Danish kindergartens, the present study conducts a socioculturally informed analysis of video-observed interactions between children and educational robots. The findings display how children and robots engage in interactions that transcend children’s mastery of CT in any narrow sense. This is examined as situated enactments of CE; as children’s critical and informed decisions regarding the roles that technologies, in this case educational robots, can play in their institutionally situated social lives. The paper concludes that children’s various enactments of CE deserve scholarly and professional attention, both as an important prerequisite for, and as a necessary limitation to, the implementation of CT in kindergartens.

AB  - Since the end of the 20th century, the digitalization of society, including the educational systems, has been growing exponentially. At the same time, education systems have been evolving towards competency-based assessment. Likewise, at the beginning of this century, the idea of Computational Thinking was resurrected by J. Wing, for solving problems and designing systems using concepts of computer science. Today, we can see how all these questions are taking shape in a new competence, called Computational Thinking, related to others that already exist. In this paper, we have studied the skills of Computational Thinking in university students, focusing on abstraction and its possible relationship with other factors. Results conclude that the students fail in relation to abstraction and in algorithmic thinking. Although the ability of abstraction is not easy to measure, a linear regression analysis has been carried out in order to determine its possible study.

AB  - Teaching computational thinking (CT) has become a priority for educators and policymakers tasked with educating and training students for future jobs which are predicted to be increasingly automated. Recent research on effective instructional interventions for developing computational thinking skills, including algorithmic and critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity, and cooperativity, suggests that teaching and learning CT can improve student academic performance. In fact, the extant literature is quite sanguine about the topic of CT. However, few studies have attempted to establish a relationship between CT skills and academic performance. In the present cross-sectional study, we employ path analysis to model the structural relationship between self-reported CT skills and academic performance of a sample of 81 computer science undergraduates enrolled at a Southwestern American university. We found few direct relationships between CT skills and academic performance. We only find a significant positive relationship between creativity and academic performance and a significant negative relationship between cooperativity and academic performance. Our findings are surprising considering the abundant research promoting computational thinking as a key component of 21st century skills. The findings call for further in-depth analysis of computational thinking and the influence on students’ learning and learning outcomes. We discuss our results with respect to recent educational mandates for including CT and instructional alignment in school curricula. Our findings contribute to the existing discussion by helping to clarify the relationship between CT skills and academic performance in higher education.

AB  - Although studies have shown that computational thinking (CT) can enhance learning processes and outcomes across traditional subjects, they have not shown how teachers might scaffold children's CT processes in a technology-mediated learning context. This exploratory study examined how teacher talk and technologies impacted the CT of three children (6 to 8 years old). Seven videotaped 90-minute sessions of weekly project-based activities yielded 4,842 turns of talk (2,974 by children). Statistical discourse analysis revealed the following results. After a teacher command, the children more often executed a sequence of actions toward a solution but less often demonstrated problem understanding than otherwise. Following a teacher's open question, the children were more likely to offer logically organized ideas. In response to a teacher's rhetorical question, they more often searched for information. These results inform educators regarding when to use each type of teacher talk to scaffold children's CT processes.

AB  - ChatGPT (generative pre-trained transformer) is one of the artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that have started to be used in programming education. However, the effect of using ChatGPT in programming education on learning processes and outcomes is not yet known. This study investigated the effect of programming education using the ChatGPT on students' computational thinking skills, programming self-efficacy, and motivation toward the lesson. The research was conducted on 45 undergraduate students who took a university-level programming course. The research was carried out according to the experimental design with the pretest-posttest control group. Students were randomly divided into experimental (n = 21) and control (n = 24) groups. While the experimental group students benefited from the ChatGPT during the weekly programming practices, the control group students did not use this tool. Research data were obtained through the computational thinking scale, computer programming self-efficacy scale, and learning motivation in computer programming courses scale. Research findings revealed that the experimental group students' computational thinking skills, programming self-efficacy, and motivation for the lesson were significantly higher than the control group students. In line with this result, it can be said that it may be useful to benefit from AI technologies such as ChatGPT in programming trainings. The research findings, it was emphasized how the most effective use of AI support in the lessons could be made, and various suggestions were made for researchers and educators in this regard.

AB  - In this paper, we explore how the theoretical notion of possibility space offers a way to study how children's computational thinking develops as a process. Drawing on embodied notions of cognition, we first examine the literature that supports how children's computational thinking emerges as a possibility space that involves conceptualizing possible actions in a given moment, deciding which action to take by anticipating the results of a possible action, and learning from the actions that they have taken. We then use a grounded approach to analyze the problem-solving process of two 5th-grade children who engaged in an educational robotics activity over two 50-minute class periods. The findings lend support for approaching children's computational thinking as a cycle of action-taking that includes conceptualizing, anticipating, and taking action. The findings also support the pedagogical practice of having children predict the results of a computer program to enhance their computational thinking. Implications for the way that teachers can support children in learning to conceptualize what is possible and take action from it are discussed.

AB  - Predictive learner modelling is crucial for personalized education. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great success in education, their potential in learner modelling via image data is unexplored. This research introduces a novel and interpretable approach for Image-based Learner Modelling (ImageLM) using CNNs and transfer learning to model learners’ performance and accordingly classify their computational thinking solutions. The approach integrates Grad-CAM, enabling it to provide insights into its decision-making process. Findings show that our custom CNN outperforms other models (namely ResNet, VGG, and Inception), with 83% accuracy in predicting solution correctness. More importantly, the ImageLM approach identifies the regions that contribute the most to the predictions, shedding light on learners' computational thinking knowledge and advancing toward trustworthy AI for education. These results underline the potential of utilizing imagery data from learners’ activities during the learning process to predict their performance, especially in challenging environments like programming where traditional feature extraction and learning might struggle.

AB  - The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has led to the proliferation of computational thinking (CT) education. However, research on unplugged activities’ influence in elementary math classrooms is limited, despite some exploring programming's cognitive benefits. This study presents both qualitative and quantitative analyzes stemming from a ten-week quasi-experimental research endeavor, specifically tailored for third-grade students. The research devised a series of unplugged activities, encompassing mathematical games, hands-on construction of mathematical logic boards, and calculating shopping discounts. The overarching objective was to investigate the impact of these unplugged activities on students’ mathematical creativity and CT. Students participating in a mathematics curriculum based on unplugged activities (N = 47) were compared with students participating in a traditional lecture-based mathematics curriculum (N = 46). The results indicated that unplugged activities exhibited significant advantages in fostering students’ CT and mathematical creativity across three dimensions, namely, problem-posing creativity (t = 5.830, p < 0.01), problem-solving creativity (t = 6.633, p < 0.01), and creative self-efficacy (t = 7.554, p < 0.01). Furthermore, the study revealed a relationship between students’ mathematical creativity as a predictor of CT. The results of the quantitative analysis were supported by the teacher's and students’ interview data, and the students felt excited and interested in the unplugged activities, whereas some students using the lecture-based method reported boredom and lack of interactivity. This research offered valuable insights for mathematics and CT education practice, underscoring unplugged activity as an innovative instructional approach that brings forth new possibilities for traditional mathematics teaching, with potential applications in the K-12 curriculum.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has received worldwide attention due to its alignment with developing 21st century skills such as creativity, problem-solving, and digital competence. With the increasing provision of programming tools such as robotic toys and tablet apps in the sector of early childhood education (ECE), many ECE researchers and practitioners tend to link CT to programming. However, children are reluctant to sustain their interests in programming activities, and may be further demotivated by debugging failures. This multi-group quasi-experimental study aimed to evaluate the effects of a story-inspired approach in bridging the gap between programming and CT for preschool children. Building on previous literature suggesting storytelling as a powerful, culturally responsive pedagogy, 5-year-old children (N=108) were involved in nine weeks of CT learning via one of the three conditions: Story-Inspired Robot Programming (SIRP), Story-Inspired Tablet Programming (SITP), and unplugged CT education. Results revealed that children who participated in the SIRP and SITP conditions showed improved CT scores, relative to unplugged CT education, even after controlling for baseline CT scores. No gender or family socioeconomic effects were found to influence the benefits of story-inspired programming interventions. These findings suggest that storytelling as a culturally responsive approach, whether using robots or tablets as a programming tool, can provide young children with more inclusive and sustainable CT learning experiences.

AB  - Content area K-12 teachers are increasingly asked to integrate computing and computational thinking into their classrooms, yet they often have little experience with computing. The purpose of this study was to understand how science teachers, new to computing and integrating computational thinking into their classrooms, supported students as computational problem solvers. In the project from which this research was drawn, 8th grade science teachers in three US school districts integrated computer game design into their study of climate systems and climate change. We conducted participant observation, collected teacher implementation logs and interviewed 15 teachers engaged in the three-year design research project, Building Systems from Scratch. Analysis through grounded theory yielded several results related to teachers’ orientations, strategies, and use of resources to create systems of distributed expertise. We identified five major themes: a) releasing responsibility to students, b) co-learning with students, c) encouraging students’ independent problem solving, d) building interdependence among students, and e) providing multiple other resources. Findings are discussed in relation to the literature on integrating computational thinking into content area classrooms.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is currently used as an umbrella term in education to describe the processes associated with learning and applying computer science concepts and strategies for problem-solving. Despite a growing body of literature on the subject within education and the development of a grand variety of tools designed to enhance computational thinking abilities, the relations between CT and other cognitive abilities have not been reported in young children. Understanding CT from a cognitive development perspective could be useful for creating targeted interventions tailored for young children. In the present study, we compare a previously reported computational thinking assessment with a battery of nine cognitive tests, which include fluid intelligence, working memory, planning, sequencing, mental rotation, vocabulary, and early math precursors such as numerical transcoding and symbolic magnitude comparison. Mixed-effects linear regressions were implemented with CT as a dependent variable to explore the associations between our variables. A subsample of children who participated in an educational robotics intervention were assessed in their robot programming performance, and its outcomes were compared with their CT assessments. Results suggest temporal sequencing ability and symbolic magnitude comparison are significant predictors of CT in kindergarten. Positive significant associations between robot programming and CT performance are reported.

AB  - The research aims to evaluate the effect of a robotics-based computational thinking program on executive functions and visuospatial skills in preschool children. Additionally, the study will explore the relationship between these three variables and early experiences with toys. The study will be a cluster-randomized controlled trial with pre- and post-intervention measures. Participants will be preschool children aged 5 to 6 years from both public and private institutions. The intervention will involve a new educational robotics device called ROVERSA and will consist of eight sessions distributed over four weeks, with the experimental group placed on a waitlist. To assess executive functions and visuospatial skills, standardized and validated neuropsychological measures will be used, including the Flanker task, the NIH Toolbox Card Sorting Test, the Corsi Block Test, the NEPSY-II Mental Rotation Test, the Pyramid of Mexico from the ENI-2 battery, and the Computational Thinking Test (CTt). Data analysis will begin with a hypothesis tested through ANOVA-MR, and linear regressions will be implemented to assess the relationship between variables. It is expected that the results will contribute to the discussion on teaching computational thinking and educational robotics as early learning experiences and their impact on the cognitive development of children.

AB  - This study examined the impact of a 10-month STEM professional development (PD) program on 25 teachers working with gifted students. The program aimed to enhance pedagogical knowledge and competencies. Findings indicated significant positive improvements in teachers' STEM self-efficacy, computational thinking, and entrepreneurship skills. The PD program also had a direct positive influence on the quality of lesson plans. The study suggests that effective PD design should incorporate scientific inquiry, engineering design processes, computational thinking, entrepreneurship skills, and the development of teachers' self-efficacy for successful implementation of PD outcomes in STEM education.

AB  - Educators emphasize that computational thinking is especially helpful in raising problem-solving skills, improving logical reasoning, and developing analytical thinking. In this context, the aim of this study is to develop an online, interactive, valid, reliable and useful performance-based assessment tool for measuring computational thinking skills. Data were collected in two stages with three different measurement tools. In the data collection phase, a psychometric scale, a skill test and an interactive web application developed in this study were used. In the study in which a total of 203 high school students participated, it was determined that the students' computational thinking skills were at average level. as a result, a valid and reliable performance-based platform was developed for measuring computational thinking skills. It has also been concluded that the performance-based measurement tool makes a better measurement than the psychometric scale. It is emphasized that computational thinking should be treated as a skill or group of skills, not as a theoretical knowledge, product/portfolio or attitude/perception. Therefore, it is believed that developing performance-based tools for evaluating computational thinking skills and measuring them by using multiple measurement tools will give more accurate results. Considering the developments in computational thinking, it is thought that the study will contribute to the literature.

AB  - Computing education has progressively entered into children's early years. Due to a proliferation of computing education programs and coding tools designed for young children, research on the relationships between computational thinking (CT) and other domains of learning and development is highly warranted. Yet, there is little empirical evidence that shows the relationship between CT and children's overall cognitive functioning. As such, this study explored the relationships between Chinese children's CT and their sequencing ability and self-regulation in early childhood. One hundred and one Chinese young children (Ngirl = 52 and Nboy = 49; Mage = 5.25, SD = 0.73) were recruited and evaluated with three reliable instruments. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that: (1) CT positively predicted sequencing ability (β = 0.27, p < .05) even after controlling for relevant demographic covariates such as age, gender, and family socioeconomic status; (2) CT positively predicted self-regulation (β = 0.47, p < .001) after controlling for demographic covariates. Our findings suggest that CT may be a domain-general ability that is based on cognitive foundations that extend beyond the realm of computing.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is regarded as the conceptual basis required for identifying and solving real-world problems through algorithmic approaches to achieve transferable solutions. Developing students' CT in primary school stages is essential and has received considerable attention. Meanwhile, researchers incorporated digital badges into classrooms to improve students' learning motivation in computer science (CS). However, few solid empirical studies analyze the effects of the digital badges approach in CS education to develop students' CT. Therefore, to bridge this gap, this study designed and implemented a block-based programming course in a primary school and examined the impact of the digital badges approach on pupils' CT skills and self-efficacy and learning motivation in CS. A quasi-experimental design was conducted among 99 third-grade students across three classes. The results revealed that the adapted digital badges in primary school (1) significantly improved the students' CT skills, (2) had no significant positive impact on their CT self-efficacy or learning motivation in CS, and (3) showed no mediating effect of learning motivation on the relationship between CT skills and CT self-efficacy. In addition, we found that whether students could see only their own digital badges or also those of others had no impact on CT skills, self-efficacy, or learning motivation in CS. These findings have implications for the design of digital badge educational interventions intended to promote students' CT and learning motivation.

AB  - Computational thinking refers to a series of cognitive processes involved in solving problems through computational systems. A growing body of studies has managed to demonstrate the correlation between computational thinking and different cognitive domains. In recent decades, multiple studies have taken place that seek to evaluate the effect of computational thinking on higher-order cognitive processes. The current study aims to contribute to this discussion by analyzing the effect of an intervention program in computational thinking on the executive functions of school-age children. In this experimental study, 30 children aged 10 and 11 were randomly assigned to an experimental group and an active control group. The instruments to collect the data were 15 tests of the neuropsychological battery of executive functions and frontal lobes BANFE-2, which were applied to both groups before and after the intervention. The experimental group participated in an 8-week computational thinking intervention during which its participants enrolled in plugged and unplugged activities and carried out block programming language twice a week. The results showed that the intervention had significant effects on executive functions associated with the anterior prefrontal cortex and the dorsolateral cortex, but not those related to the orbitofrontal area.

AB  - Learning coding during early childhood is an effective way for children to practice computational thinking. Aspects of children's motivation can increase the likelihood that children approach computational thinking activities with enthusiasm and deep engagement. Gender inequities may interfere with children's readiness to take advantage of opportunities to build computational thinking skills through activities such as coding. Societal stereotypes can reduce young girls’ motivation to engage with computer science, preventing them from gaining benefits from coding activities designed to support computational thinking. This study examined children's gender stereotypes as well as children's own motivation for computer coding in 363 first- through third-grade children. We assessed gender differences in both stereotypes and motivation, as well as links between the stereotypes that individual children held and their own motivation. Children generally endorsed stereotypes about interest and ability for computer coding that favored their own-gender group, although third-grade girls reported gender-egalitarian beliefs about interest in coding. There were no gender differences in children's motivation for computer coding in terms of their own interest, sense of belonging, or ability self-concepts. Children's stereotypes about their own-gender group were significantly positively correlated with their own motivation for computer coding. These findings suggest that early childhood represents an excellent age for children to begin building computational thinking skills, before girls endorse negative stereotypes about their gender's interest in computer science.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is an essential skill students need if they are to adapt to the rise of digital society, and the evaluation of CT is crucial for enhancing students’ CT. However, the current evaluation of CT is based on a summative paradigm and ignores real CT performance during the assessment process. This study thus used a multimodal cognitive diagnostic model (H-MCDM) of students’ CT based on multimodal data in situational tasks, to achieve precise evaluation and explore the current mastery status of students’ CT and their cognitive and behavioral characteristics. The research results indicate that: 1) students’ CT was at a moderately high level and indicated a good grasp of the CT components of problem decomposition and algorithm design, but students had not yet mastered problem abstraction, 2) a total of six different CT latent patterns were discerned in the overall student results, 3) individual students who shared the same CT latent patterns could differ in their cognitive and behavioral characteristics, while those with different CT latent patterns could share similar characteristics. This study showed that it is possible to capture the degree of students’ mastery of CT and their cognitive and behavioral differences with the same or different CT latent patterns at a granular level, providing a basis for developing individualized strategies to enhance students’ CT.

AB  - In-service elementary school teachers need training to teach computational thinking (CT). A common model for CT professional learning programs includes an initial workshop followed by ongoing support. However, little research has examined the efficacy of ongoing support, the most effective types, and its impact on classroom practices. The current study details a multifaceted CT professional learning program with innovative ongoing support to help elementary school teachers implement the Code.org curriculum. It also empirically investigated the impact of the support on teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT, the effectiveness of each component of the support, and to what extent it affected teachers' classroom practices. Our ongoing support included an additional workshop, grade-level professional learning community (PLC) sessions, instructional videos, and teacher leaders' support. Data included a pre-survey, four post-surveys, lesson observations, a focus group interview, tracking the number of video views, and surveys from PLC participants and teacher leaders. Results indicated that the ongoing support significantly increased teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT. Regarding the effectiveness of the various components of the ongoing support, the additional workshop significantly increased teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT. Teachers valued each component of the support, and this support improved teachers’ classroom practices.

AB  - The present study investigates the debugging process of 526 children in preschool (4–6 aged) when programming a tangible robot. When a child is involved in programming, it is needed to identify and correct errors, or in other words, debug a program. Debugging is a high-level thinking skill and is an essential component closely related to developing Computational Thinking in early childhood education. Though the debugging process is a cognitive function in programming investigated by many researchers in recent decades, most studies are conducted either in primary, secondary education, or higher education concerning beginners or experts in programming. Very few reviews, and some focus on preschool education. Our study set out the following objectives: 1) How do children identify the existence of error and locate it? 2) What types of errors emerge when coding? 3) What type of error is complex for novice programmers? 4) What strategies are developed by novice programmers to debug effectively? and 5) What types of knowledge do novice programmers construct by debugging the tangible robot Bee-Bot? The study follows an iterative model of a design-based research approach. It uses multiple case studies to collect qualitative and quantitative data. The programming intervention was implemented by 30 educators in their classrooms and was based on a scenario-based teaching design. The debugging process was analysed using Klahr & Craven's framework (1988): 1) test and evaluate program, 2) identify bug, 3) represent program, 4) locate bug and 5) correct bug. The main finding is the construction and development of syntactic and semantic knowledge.

AB  - A plethora of programming platforms purports to teach preschool-aged children computational thinking (CT) and coding skills. However, the empirical evidence to support their effectiveness is still in its early stages. A three-week didactic intervention using ScratchJr was conducted to investigate its effectiveness in fostering CT and rudimentary coding skills in a cohort of preschool children (N = 34, aged 4–6 years). While the initial performance mean of the control group (M = 7.07, SD = 2.58) exhibits a statistically significant elevation t (22.64 = 2.23, p = 0.036) vis-à-vis the experimental group (M = 5.35, SD = 1.58), t (22.64) = 2.23, p = 0.0 the terminal performance means of both groups converge closely. However, meticulous data analysis unveils a statistically notable enhancement among preschool participants exposed to the educational intervention involving ScratchJr. Notably, both instructional modalities appear commensurate in nurturing elementary computational tenets, namely modularity and control structures. The experimental cohort outperforms the control group with statistical significance in comprehending potent ideational constructs encompassing representation, algorithms, and hardware/software interplay. Conversely, the control group performs better in grasping the debugging concept than their experimental counterparts. The outcomes lend substantive credence to the efficacy of the distinct programming milieu offered by ScratchJr, underscoring its effectiveness in cultivating CT and coding proficiencies within the preschool demographic.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is crucial for students. Robot-supported learning has emerged as a popular approach for CT cultivation. To understand the effects of robot-supported CT cultivation, the current study conducted a meta-analysis to analyze studies from Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Science Direct databases (2012–2022) which screened using keywords ``computational thinking'' and ``robot''. After further screening, 26 peer-reviewed articles were selected. We synthesized the 33 effect sizes to assess the overall effectiveness of robot-supported learning on CT and its sub-dimensions: concepts, practices, and perspectives. Our findings revealed a medium effect of robot-supported learning on students' CT (g = 0.643), a large effect on CT concepts (g = 0.650), a medium effect on CT practices (g = 0.587), and a huge effect on CT perspectives (g = 1.419). We also explored the moderators (i.e., grade level, study duration, culture, learning strategy, and assessment tool) that might influence the effects of robot-supported CT cultivation. Moderator analyses indicated that short-term (less than four weeks) robot-supported learning had a larger effect (g = 0.901) on CT practice than long-term (more than eleven weeks) learning (g = 0.309). This meta-analysis indicates that educators could apply robot-supported learning to cultivate students' CT and concludes with related implications.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has gained increasing recognition as a 21st-century competency. Although initiatives have been taken to define the term for educational practices, limited empirical evidence is available to clarify its underlying components, especially at the primary education level. This study aimed to identify the associations between CT and specific cognitive skills in the primary school context. Based on the literature, three cognitive domains were studied (i.e., mathematical, visuospatial, and reasoning skills) and standard test batteries were applied to a sample of 633 primary students (aged 7–12 years). Linear regression analyses were performed with CT performance as the dependent variable to investigate its associations with the measured cognitive skills, and demographic features (i.e., age, gender) and coding learning experience (i.e., years of coding experience, extra-curricular coding experience) were included as control variables. The results indicated that the students’ CT performance was significantly predicted by their attainments in numeracy, visual perception, spatial visualisation, and inductive reasoning, and the results remained significant after controlling for demographics and coding experience. The study adds to the literature by enriching the understanding of CT as a psychological construct and has practical implications for educational stakeholders regarding the importance of interdisciplinary teaching and the integration of specific cognitive skills into CT learning activities.

AB  - The sustainable and digital future of work may imply a dramatic equilibrium change between social factors and technological ones. We argue that providing suitable tools to support End-User Development (EUD) in the workplace could represent a way to cope with such future changes. The contributions of this paper include the analysis and characterization of the most used EUD techniques and their crossover with a new conveyed model of Computational Thinking. The synthesis between these aspects is made explicit in the construct of EUDability, which is designed to capture the quality dimensions of EUD systems suitable to work scenarios where better roles and better tools for individuals may be shaped. EUDability has to do with identifying and assessing the difficulties of EUD techniques on one side and the Computational Thinking skills held by individuals on the other side.

AB  - There has been an increasing interest in the integration of technology into language education. Meanwhile, computational thinking (CT) skills are fostered which influence communicative language teaching and learning. Despite CT's established importance in science education, its significance in language teaching remains scarce. This study contributes to knowledge synthesis and methodological development by reviewing 16 journal articles, analyzing CT applications in language learning across educational contexts, intervention tools, CT skills, language acquisition, and assessment methods. The results indicate that (a) more CT-involved activities are needed for primary, secondary, and tertiary education, (b) educational robots and Scratch stand out as the most trending intervention tools, (c) CT skills such as decomposition, abstraction, generalization and so on have a positive effect on students’ foreign language acquisition, especially in grammar and writing, (d) assessment of CT development can be surveyed through a validated and reliable instrument such as computer programming self-efficacy scale or an online platform: Dr. Scratch; Conversely, there is a diversity of evaluation tools in foreign language learning. This study is the first to review experimental research on integrating computational thinking into foreign language learning and offers significant implications for future research.

AB  - The development of programming skills and computational thinking in the formal educational context is one of the most recent horizons set by many educational systems worldwide. Although the first computational thinking initiatives are being applied from the earliest school ages, this research focuses on the secondary education level. Specifically, the objective is the following: to analyse the implementation of Arduino, as well as the benefits and opportunities it brings to secondary school students. For this purpose, documentary research has been undertaken applying a systematic review according to the PRISMA 2020 framework following the PiCoS strategy. Atlas.ti 9 was used to analyse the information. Out of 316 papers identified, 37 were included in the research. In relation to the results, Arduino is primarily used in technology and physics subjects, although it is also used to develop interdisciplinary STEAM projects. As a rule, it is used to learn programming languages, but likewise as a resource to develop science experiments. LED lights, servomotors and breadboards are among the most commonly used resources together with the Arduino board. and Scratch was the most widely used software. The initiatives implemented have yielded both positive and negative results, for example, one drawback is that some projects are very difficult, and some achievements such as: increased motivation towards the contents addressed or also the development of some soft skills, such as problem solving.

AB  - Recently, virtual reality (VR) technology has shown great potential in advancing education with many pedagogical benefits for building the 21st-century teaching and learning experience. This study conducted a formative evaluation of an immersive VR expedition application with the aim of understanding users' learning processes and how the application facilitates higher education students' computational thinking skills. Six participants were randomly selected to conduct this evaluation. A mixed research approach consisting of quantitative and qualitative methods was employed. The study quantitatively analyzed users' scores from gameplay to understand how the intervention supported computational thinking skills. Participants were also interviewed to collect data after playing the mini-games to investigate users' experiences. The study showcases players' computational thinking competency, assessed automatically during gameplay. Further, this study used inductive content analysis to demonstrate users' reactions to prototyped VR mini-games. The qualitative findings suggest that users found the VR mini-games interactive and immersive, which provided an opportunity to foster learners' computational thinking skills. The quantitative analysis revealed that student's computational thinking competency can be enhanced through consistent playing of the mini-games. Moreover, the expedition aspect of the VR game stimulated learners' curiosity, which sustained their learning progress. Furthermore, users gained new knowledge and found the mini-games educative. Nevertheless, several aspects of the VR mini-games need improvements, according to users' perceptions. This study contributes to the knowledge in terms of the affordances of VR in education research and provides relevant insights that can shape future studies, for example, the recent hype of metaverse in education.

AB  - Project-Based Learning (PBL) and Computational Thinking (CT), a teaching strategy and a problem-solving method, respectively, have been widely used in teaching and learning because of their educational advantages for students and teachers. However, studies of their integration into the teaching and learning process have been scarce, resulting in a lack of guidance for educators to implement such an approach that apply constructivism learning theory. This study aims to systematically review and identify appropriate frameworks, models, techniques and tools that could guide the successful implementation of PBL-CT. This study examined relevant articles published from 2017 to 2021 to highlight the gaps in the PBL-CT execution and map their backgrounds into a coherent taxonomy that could help guide the directions of future studies. As revealed, none of such articles explicitly explain any suitable PBL-CT frameworks or models. The study identified several common elements for the PBL-CT framework formulation, indicating scaffolding and inquiry are the most commonly applied techniques, with visual tools dominating the PBL-CT implementation. Most articles involved computing, followed by STEM, with a few originating from non-STEM fields. Several important implications could help educators develop an effective PBL-CT course design and provide some guidelines for future research. An effective PBL-CT integration enhances teaching and learning besides improving students' computational thinking skills. Thinking skills are critical 21st-century skills needed for students' success.

AB  - Computational thinking has become an integral component of curricula worldwide, necessitating teachers to develop this competence in their students. To effectively meet these curricular requirements, teachers themselves need a solid foundation of computational thinking content knowledge, which refers to the understanding and skills they possess in this area. However, despite widespread recognition of this need, few studies have rigorously examined teachers' content knowledge in this domain. Addressing this gap requires the development of high-quality measurement tools. This study details the development of an instrument, created as part of the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) 2023 in Flanders, to measure lower secondary school teachers' computational thinking content knowledge in a valid and reliable way. The article first outlines the construction process of the instrument, which involved close collaboration with experts in the field and drew upon the framework of Fraillon et al. (2023). Following this, the instrument's psychometric properties are presented, which include both item-level and overall instrument characteristics. These properties were evaluated using data from a sample of 352 participants, applying both Classical Test Theory and Item Response Theory. The final tool consists of sixteen multiple-choice and short constructed response questions. The results indicate favorable item and overall instrument characteristics, thereby affirming its potential to measure the intended construct in a valid and accurate way.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) skills help students both understand and utilize computing in various domains to cope with the challenges posed by the complex digital world. This study applied mind mapping to programming language instruction in a primary school, and explored the effects of mind mapping on students' CT skills when learning programming with Scratch as a programming tool. Two types of mind mapping, construct-by-self mind mapping (CBS-MM) and construct-on-scaffold mind mapping (COS-MM), were proposed to compare which type is more effective in terms of students' CT skills. Seventy-three public primary school fifth-grade students aged 10 to 11 participated in the study. The CBS group included 33 students learning with the CBS-MM instructional approach, while the COS group comprised 40 students learning with the COS-MM instructional approach. Data were obtained from nine topic Scratch programming assignments and pre- and post-CT skills surveys completed by the two groups. Paired sample t tests were used to analyze whether the two types of mind mapping approach could improve both groups' CT skills. One-way ANCOVA and one-way ANOVA were used to examine the difference in the two groups' CT skills. The results showed that both CBS-MM and COS-MM can improve students' CT skills; however, the COS group students could better improve their CT skills with the assistance of the COS-MM method compared with the CBS group students who learned with the CBS-MM method. The findings of this study can provide some enlightenment for relevant instructors to design instruction and implement programming teaching with different kinds of mind mapping support that facilitates students’ CT.

AB  - The specific mechanisms by which teachers and parents can provide culturally relevant opportunities for computational thinking for racially/ethnically and linguistically diverse groups of preschoolers remain unknown. Accordingly, the purpose of this research is to examine how PreK parent and teacher voice directed efforts to realize a culturally relevant computing program. We drew data sources from a subsample of design-based research meetings in which partners collaborated to co-develop the first iteration of the program. Using qualitative analysis, we examined how parent voice and teacher voice, conceptualized as perspectives and participation, influenced theories of culturally responsive computing and computational thinking in early childhood education and the translation of theory into practice in classroom and home settings. Findings showed that connecting powerful ideas from computational thinking, namely algorithms and problem solving (e.g., debugging), to familiar activities and experiences served as a powerful entry point. Yet, differences arose in how teachers and parents conceptualized culturally relevant computing and made connections to familiar routines. We discuss what can be learned from parent voice in regards to bolstering children's self-expression, access to increasingly complex computational thinking tasks, and opportunities for learning cultural and community values through computing.

AB  - In recent years, the development of computational thinking (CT) has become integral to many school curricula worldwide. This has been associated with calls for computational thinking to be considered a ‘21St Century’ competency, valuable to all students as a transferable process for solving problems and building understanding of human behaviour and systems. However, while computational thinking is a focus of most secondary school computer science curricula, proponents such as Jeanette Wing argue its relevance for younger students, indicating more work must be done investigating its development in early years' education. This study used a structured, problem-based curriculum supported by guided inquiry pedagogy, to explore 6 year old students' learning of basic computational thinking concepts and practices while coding programmable floor robots (Blue-bots and an iPad app). Results indicated improvement across the seven lessons in students' sequencing/algorithm authoring, error correction, and pattern recognition. Furthermore, they revealed evidence of higher order thinking such as identifying patterns in code, and how these can be transferred to help solve problems of different designs. While currently play-based approaches are used to introduce computational thinking concepts and practices in early years' education, results from this study suggest that more structured, problem-based methods should be seriously considered. Results challenge commonly understood developmental theories about what young children can and can't do, contextualised within the field of computer science, and hold implications for early years' teachers' professional knowledge and pedagogy if they are to promote their students' learning in this increasingly important area. Given rapid technological advancements such as artificial intelligence (AI) and increasingly earlier exposure of young children to digitally-mediated information, this study provides support for the earlier and more systematic introduction of basic digital literacy knowledge and skills in early years' education.

In this study, we investigated the robots used, proposed activities, and evaluation processes. We also analyzed research contexts and the stated motivations to conduct the studies. Our review identified characteristics of the robots, such as input and output interfaces, cost, and availability. We also categorized activities considering context, modality of work, type of activities, duration, adults’ role, scaffolding, unplugged activities, explicit debugging, communication and sharing instances, and teaching knowledge from other domains. We analyzed the computational thinking evaluation process looking at types of assessments, asset concepts, and research design. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of existing research, identifies existing gaps, and provides recommendations for future studies.

AB  - The integration of computational thinking (CT) into K-12 education offers substantial potential to improve digital literacy and deepen students’ understanding across various subject areas. By embedding computational procedures and solution-oriented approaches into traditional curricula, students can develop essential skills that are critical for thriving in an increasingly digital world. However, the effective integration of CT into subject-specific learning poses challenges for educators, largely due to a lack of training and experience in implementing interdisciplinary instructional strategies. This study explores the impact of integrating CT into K-12 education through diverse instructional approaches, including modelling, storytelling, and unplugged activities. The research examines how students' subject knowledge, CT concepts, and practices evolved under each CT integration practice, as well as their acceptance toward CT integrated lessons. The study was conducted in different subjects, including language arts, biology, and physics, and at different grade levels. The technology acceptance model was used as a theoretical framework to understand students' adoption towards the different integration practices. The study revealed that different CT integration practices yield varying impacts on students' attitudes, particularly in relation to their prior programming experiences. Namely, primary school students with prior programming experience display a higher behavioural intention due to a lack of early biases toward programming. Conversely, secondary school students, less familiar with interdisciplinary approaches, initially show less enthusiasm for future engagement. These insights underscore the need for tailored instructional strategies that consider students' prior experiences and the broader goal of preparing them to contribute to a technologically driven society.

AB  - As we begin to identify essential skills for the future, there has been an increased focus on how to define and implement computational thinking within education. However, the question of how to engage children with coding activities within the context and limitations of the curriculum remains relatively explored. In our study, a human-centered design approach was followed to guide a small group of children through the co-design, implementation and evaluation of a board game. The board game had two versions: an offline version involving a robotic agent and an online version with its digital equivalent. A mixed-method approach was used to understand and compare levels of engagement, usability, and collaboration in both versions of the game. The tangible aspect of working with a robotic agent in the offline version led to greater levels of motivation and involvement with the game mechanics. Tangible robotics games tend to be more approachable for children. Our study shows that using such games by connecting the mathematics curriculum with coding problems can successfully engage participants in collaborative computational thinking activities. We contribute to the field by providing human-centered guidance for the creation of educational tools to develop computational thinking. Such guidance is not only applicable in technologically rich environments; it can also be applied in educational communities with limited access to technology.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has been relevant in teaching STEM courses, and educators are incorporating both plugged and unplugged CT activities in their modules to prepare new entrants for advanced knowledge. However, additional empirical data are needed to understand how an unplugged activities approach can lead to an improved understanding of CT concepts. Therefore, this study investigates the impact of unplugged activities on novice students' CT skills and unravels the characteristics of students' CT competency from performing unplugged activities. The experimental aspect of this study was conducted with a cohort of 210 students participating in an introductory programming course at a University in Nigeria. A mixed-method research approach and a quasi-experimental design were applied in this study to understand how the unplugged approach in teaching CT could help students improve their CT competency. A paired-sample t-test of familiarity score for each CT concept showed a significant increase in the score before and after the intervention. Furthermore, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was used for topic modeling of the text describing students’ solutions. Topic modeling allows for more insights into the steps taken by the students to solve CT problems. Only 27.62 % of students' solution descriptions contained CT concepts, 56.90 % of the students solved the puzzle with an optimal score, and 72.41 % of students who applied CT concepts of problem abstraction and decomposition were able to solve the puzzle correctly. Indeed, CT unplugged activities significantly increased the number of students who gained CT competency. In addition, this study provides recommendation for computer science educators and highlight future direction.

AB  - Computational thinking is a fundamental competence that is being introduced in K-12 and succeeding curricula worldwide. Despite this huge effort, many computational thinking models in the literature do not explicitly take into consideration the pupils’ age and the developmental nature of computational thinking skills. Furthermore, many existing computational thinking models are focused on the internal thinking processes of the individuals, failing to explicitly consider the situated nature, in terms of social context and artefactual environment, that usually characterise tasks that require computational thinking to be solved. In this paper, we present a framework for the design, realisation, analysis, and assessment of computational thinking activities, called CT-cube. The CT-cube allows to extend existing computational thinking models to consider the life-long development of computational thinking skills in individuals, from childhood to adult age, and to take into consideration the situated nature of computational thinking activities. We use the CT-cube to design an unplugged task, called Cross Array Task (CAT), allowing to assess the algorithmic skills of K-12 pupils and we show how the CT-cube can be used in this case to illustrate the development of this competence along the entire compulsory school path, considering a sample of 109 pupil aged 3 to 16 in Switzerland.

AB  - The current single teaching and assessing modes of English as a foreign language (EFL) grammar in China have caused the disconnect between grammar knowledge and competency with numerous errors in essay writing, somehow ignoring the analysis of learners thinking patterns. To solve the problem, computational thinking (CT), a higher-order thinking in solving problems and optimizing the way to acquire knowledge, was employed in the study. As needed, the experimental group was taught using the CT teaching model following CT principal elements (data analysis, pattern recognition, abstraction, decomposition, and parallelization), while the control group followed the traditional teaching mode. Quantitative and qualitative data were obtained based on the pre-test-post-test, classroom observation, and questionnaire survey. The results show that the grammar application in short essay writing of all the members of the experimental group significantly improved and that higher grammar learning agency and engagement were unfolded to show the changes of thinking patterns. However, not all the members from the control group showed similar results. CT serves as an important social mediation tool in EFL teaching. This study further enriches the teaching modes of grammar and is an effective attempt at introducing CT into learners’ thinking patterns.

AB  - With growing interest in supporting the development of computational thinking (CT) in early childhood, there is also need for new assessments that serve multiple purposes and uses. In particular, there is a need to understand the design of formative assessments that can be used during classroom instruction to provide feedback to teachers and children in real-time. In this paper, we report on an empirical study and advance a new unit of observational analysis for formative assessment that we call an indicator of a knowledge refinement opportunity or as a shorthand, KRO indicators. We put forth a new framework for conceptualizing the design of formative assessments that builds on the Evidence Centered Design framework but centers identification and analysis of indicators of knowledge refinement opportunities. We illustrate a number of key indicators through empirical examples drawn from video recordings of Kindergarten classroom lessons.

AB  - Interest in coding education has exploded in the past five years, especially in elementary and early secondary education. Teachers who are largely new to coding are expected to guide entire student bodies through the fundamentals of coding and computational thinking. But little is known about which coding and computational thinking (CT) concepts teachers feel most comfortable with and which concepts they struggle with. This study describes 127 elementary coding teachers’ changes in their beliefs about teaching coding and CT as they participated in year-long continuous professional development. Novice elementary coding teachers demonstrated most growth in their self-efficacy for teaching sequences, algorithms and loops. They were less secure in their knowledge of conditionals, variables, and functions. For computational thinking, teachers were most confident in their ability to identify patterns, think algorithmically, understand logic, and evaluate outcomes, showing less growth with decomposition and abstraction.

AB  - This study compares the effects of coding education with educational robot and unplugged coding activities on pre-school students' computational thinking and executive function skills. This study used a pre-test and post-test comparison group quasi-experimental design. The study was conducted in a public kindergarten with 48 pre-school students (24 educational robot- BeeBot® group and 24-unplugged coding group) aged 5-6. The TechCheck-K test was used to measure computational thinking skills, and Executive Functions Battery-Computerized Touch was used to measure executive function skills. The process started with pre-test applications and ended with post-tests after four weeks (16 different sessions) of the implementation in both groups. The study found a statistically significant difference between the computational thinking pre-test and post-test scores of pre-school students in both groups in favor of the post-test. It was determined that there was a statistically significant difference in favor of the educational robot group between the post-test scores of computational thinking skills. In addition, when the findings regarding executive functions were evaluated, there was a statistically significant difference between the pre-test and post-test scores of total executive function in favor of the post-test in both groups. However, it was observed that there was no statistically significant difference between the post-test scores of both groups in terms of total executive function skills scores. In addition, when the post-test scores of pre-school students in two groups were evaluated, it was determined that there was no significant difference in computational thinking and executive function skills according to gender. Consequently, it was determined that coding education with an educational robot was more effective for gaining computational thinking skills than unplugged coding activities for pre-school students. However, it was observed that there was no difference between the two groups in terms of the development of executive function skills in pre-school education.

AB  - Since environmental and energy issues and challenges continues to emerge as key global concerns, Green Building Certification Systems are becoming increasingly relevant in the construction industry. In this regard, LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is considered one of the most widely recognized environmental assessment methods used globally in the construction industry today. However, due to the high level of complexity of the LEED system, the tools usually used to verify the achievement of the credits lack of “design friendliness” and hardly communicate effectively with the conventional tools used by architects and engineers (e.g. CAD, BIM). This makes difficult to fully take into account, especially at the early design stage, the many interconnected aspects that contribute to the green certification, with consequent issues often arising in the design validation and/or construction phases, resulting in time delays and cost increments. The application of innovative problem-solving methods, such as computational thinking, together with coding techniques, represents an effective way to deal with this issue. This kind of methodology, in fact, allows the requirements of a specific LEED credit to be digitally parametrised and flexibly incorporated into a “designer friendly” working environment. In particular, Visual Programming Languages (VPLs), due to their high simplicity of usage, allow architects and engineers to develop algorithms and thus implement their technical knowledge in the field of environmental design with computer programming skills, useful to improve their tools and keep them constantly updated. The aim of this paper is to illustrate a methodology through which, by merging computational thinking strategies with VPL tools, is possible to keep under control, in the same working environment, all the parameters required to verify in real time the achievement of LEED credits. To demonstrate the flexibility of the approach, dedicated tools developed for the verification of some specific credits at different scales – neighbourhood and building – are illustrated as operational examples of the proposed methodology.

AB  - Computational thinking, defined by Wing (2011) as the “thought processes involved in formulating problems … so that the solutions are represented in a form that can effectively be carried out by an information-processing agent,” has become the central construct of K12 computing education around the world. This article provides a history of computational thinking, a summary of computational thinking's role in educational policy and practice, role as a research construct, and concludes by considering the future of computational thinking. The debate over how to define and teach computational thinking can be understood as a proxy for the broader questions about education.

AB  - Collecting and organizing data to understand and answer real-world questions is an increasingly important skill in our current world. Fostering data collection and analysis (DCA) skills in young children leverages key mathematics skills as well as the data representation, visualization, and interpretation skills of computational thinking (CT), culminating in a problem-solving approach with data. As such, the intervention, comprising investigations and a digital app, supported preschool teachers and children to answer data-focused questions by engaging in each step of the DCA process in order to foster CT and math skills. Teachers appreciated that the app offers a new way for children to visualize data and noted that the app provided learning opportunities for children that would not otherwise be possible or easy to implement. Results also suggest that the app provides a systematic process for data collection, entry, and interpretation. Children in classrooms that completed the intervention had significantly higher scores at post-intervention compared to children in classrooms that did not complete the intervention, controlling for pre-intervention scores, B(SE) = 0.13(0.05), t (6) = 2.48, p = .048.

AB  - Computational Thinking (CT), the conceptual foundations required for solving complex problems effectively and efficiently, is an imperative skill for today's learners, across disciplines and across ages. As for its importance in the wide network of digital literacies, CT has been implemented in various educational contexts, however mostly via digital artifacts, specifically in programming-related activities. This approach does not fulfill the potential of such integration for promoting learning. In this paper, we argue that digital literacies should not be bound to the digital realm, and present a novel approach to fully integrate CT into learning and teaching by the development of CT-infused “unplugged” pedagogical tools that are fully embedded in the subject matter. We demonstrate the advantages to student learning of these tools in two case studies from K-12 mathematics education: 1) An assistive tool for function investigation in high-school calculus – in this case, we point out to how CT skills that were implemented in the tool promoted students' problem solving; 2) A teaching unit for pattern sequences in elementary school – in this case, we show how students in the CT research group outperformed students in the other groups, and how they implemented CT to solve pattern sequence problems effectively and efficiently. We highlight that besides enhancing learning, this approach can help address the important issue of equity in education, and suggest ways to promote it via dedicated professional development.

AB  - Creativity and Computational Thinking (CT) have been pointed out as two important skills that would promote students in the digital age as contributing members of society. Therefore, these two constructs have been extensively researched in recent years, but the associations between them are yet to be fully understood. This study takes another step towards bridging this gap by examining the association between CT and three types of creativity, i.e., Figural Creative Thinking, Verbal Creative Thinking, and Computational Creativity. Data was collected from 119 ninth-grade students (14–15 years old) from Israel. Students took two commonly used creativity tests (Torrance's Test of Creative Thinking, and the Alternative Uses Test). They also used Kodetu—an online learning environment for CT—and we used the system log files to measure their CT acquirement and their computational creativity. Findings suggest some nuanced associations between the four sets of variables. Specifically, we point out the limited associations between verbal and figural creativities, some of which are negative; also, we found that the associations between creative thinking and CT, as well as between creative thinking and computational creativity, differ by gender.

AB  - Many studies have demonstrated that Virtual Exchange (VE) for teaching languages can have a positive effect on learners' intercultural awareness or achievements. However, during this century, the teaching process has shifted from teaching with technology to solving problems with it. In this regard, pedagogical experts in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) have developed programming and robotics based on Computational Thinking skills (CTs), which have been regarded as the core of 21st-century skills. In the field of CALL, this skill has received very little attention. Accordingly, we have attempted to switch the process and outcome of language learning in VE. Thus, we developed the conceptual framework that integrated CTsCALL and Individual-technology-task-environment Fit (ITTEF). Having designed our VE tasks based on CTsCALL, we provided the opportunity for 92 Spanish language learners in our project to exchange language and culture with Cypriot and Irish students and solve VE tasks based on CTsCALL. The result of the symmetric phase of the study validated the five-dimensional structure of CTsCALL and the four-dimensional structures of ITTEF in VE and CALL. It also revealed that language learners, who focused on the key information rather than the details while solving language tasks, as well as recognizing the pattern of task solving and applying them to other tasks, found VE, and CTsCALL to be aligned with their current capabilities, learning environment, and problem-solving skills that mediated their intention to learn and exchange information in this context in the future. Furthermore, the asymmetrical part of the study revealed that sixteen solutions are available to shape language learners' continued intention to use VE by combining the components of CTsCALL and ITTEF. Thus, the study developed the CTsCALL questionnaire and its theory into CALL together with the Council of Europe's Common European Framework of Reference for Languages and recommended that CALL researchers and educators take a broader view of VE, as well as continuing to validate CTsCALL in other CALL disciplines to show that this skill belongs to CALL as well.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is gaining increasing attention from researchers and practitioners all over the world to empower children in the digital era. However, there is no consensus on which components of CT to teach beginning coders in early childhood education (ECE). To address this issue, we conducted a systematic review of 42 empirical studies focused on teaching and assessing CT in ECE. We analyzed the included studies with the three-dimensional CT framework proposed by Brennan and Resnick (2012) and demonstrated how this framework could be modified to fit the context of ECE. Based on this systematic review, we sorted out the CT components that were proven suitable for young children to learn by incorporating emerging components and removing components inappropriate for young children. We thus proposed a CT curriculum framework for ECE that covers CT concepts (i.e., control flow/structures, representation, and hardware/software), CT practices (i.e., algorithmic design, pattern recognition, abstraction, debugging, decomposition, iteration, and generalizing), and CT perspectives (i.e., expressing and creating, connecting, perseverance, and choices of conduct). This systematic review and its associated CT curriculum framework provide important theoretical contributions and practical implications for early childhood CT education.

AB  - In this paper, we review and meta-analyze the findings of experimental studies published between 2006 and 2022 that examined the effects of coding and programming interventions on children's core and higher order executive functions (response inhibition, working memory, cognitive flexibility, planning and problem solving). The systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to address three research questions: 1) Which executive functions are most impacted by the teaching of CT? 2) Which instructional modality (educational robotics/virtual coding/unplugged coding) is most effective in enhancing executive function skills in learners aged 4–16 years? and 3) Does the cognitive effectiveness of coding vary with children's age? A total of 19 studies with 1523 participants met the selection criteria for the systematic review. The meta-analysis included 11 of those studies. The results reveal beneficial effects of structured virtual and tangible coding (educational robotics) activities for preschoolers and first graders, and significant effects of more unstructured virtual coding activities (e.g., Scratch-based) for older students. A multivariate fixed-effects model meta-analysis shows that the teaching of coding significantly improves problem-solving with the highest effect (dppc2 = 0.89), but also planning (dppc2 = 0.36), and inhibition and working memory with lower effects (dppc2 = 0.17, dppc2 = 0.20).

AB  - In light of the increasing importance digital economy, the significance of computational thinking has grown exponentially, becoming imperative in both workplace and academic settings such as universities. This article addresses the critical need to comprehend the factors influencing the acceptance of computational thinking. The dataset introduces an extensive questionnaire comprising five constructs and 25 items, rooted in the extended Technology Acceptance Model. Notably, the model incorporates facilitating conditions and subjective norm, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding acceptance. Data collection involved 132 undergraduate university students sampled through purposive sampling, specifically targeting courses with a focus on computational thinking. The resulting dataset serves as a valuable resource for future research, offering detailed insights into the factors determining the acceptance of technology in educational contexts beyond mere thinking skills. Given the scarcity of research on technology acceptance in developing nations, this dataset holds particular significance, serving as a foundation for potential cross-cultural comparisons. The dataset contributes to the field by presenting a robust acceptance model, explaining 74.2 per cent of the variance in behavioural intention, 60.2 per cent in perceived usefulness, and 56.1 per cent in perceived ease of use. This high explanatory power positions the dataset as a superior resource for replication, benchmarking, and broader applicability in diverse contexts, thereby enhancing the understanding of computational thinking acceptance across different populations and settings. This dataset stands among the pioneering efforts to assess the novel covariance-based structural equation model algorithm within SmartPLS 4, presenting a valuable resource for future research employing the same mechanism.

AB  - This paper describes a study designed to investigate the promise of resources that support the development of computational thinking (CT) in preschool children. This study was the culmination of a collaborative research process between researchers and media developers of a home-based intervention that included media and hands-on activities created to support the development of young children's CT. The mixed-methods study included 108 families, each with a 4- or 5-year-old child. Families, who participated in the study at home for six weeks, were randomly assigned to an intervention group that viewed media and engaged with hands-on activities with a CT focus or a control group that viewed and engaged with non-STEM literacy content. Data collection consisted of parent surveys, parent interviews, and CT learning and pre-coding tasks to assess children's CT abilities. Results indicate that the learning intervention demonstrates promise in supporting parental understanding of CT. Experience with the intervention over the six weeks also appeared to cultivate some CT strategy use in children as evidenced by parental reports and performance on learning and pre-coding sequencing tasks.

AB  - This study characterizes the literature on teaching computational thinking (CT) to preschoolers aged 4 to 5 years. Previous research and published systematic studies have provided important contributions about CT teaching to elementary and high school children. However, to date, there is no systematic overview of CT education for preschoolers. For this reason, this systematic mapping synthesizes 82 studies on CT teaching, through the implementation and evaluation of tools and activities to teach, improve or measure the CT knowledge acquired by children. Furthermore, studies on courses or training offered to preschool teachers related to the teaching of CT were also considered. From the selected studies, the following information was collected: year of publication; recovery sources and databases; vehicles and places of publication; temporal delimitation of research, research approach, nature and research method; CT teaching approaches; tools used to teach CT and how they are classified according to their physical characteristics and, finally, participants and individuals responsible for the research. The results suggest an increase in the number of publications in recent years, revealing the interest of researchers in the topic. Furthermore, we observed a trend towards the use of physical artifacts and the use of the disconnected computing approach to teaching CT skills to preschool children. The results also exposed that preschool teachers have little autonomy in implementing CT teaching activities because those are mostly implemented by computer professionals (researchers, teachers, etc.). This is because preschool teachers are still discouraged from teaching computer and technology-related content to children, considering them complex and disconnected from basic curricula. However, when teachers are trained to teach CT, they become interested in the content and become more active during the teaching process. We argue for integrating CT-related content into education curricula and supporting preschool teachers to implement it autonomously in their classrooms.

AB  - This paper deals within a context where technology plays a pivotal role in education. In this sense, it is essential to highlight the emergence of new competencies and skills in education due to technological advancements. Legislative frameworks have been developed to incorporate digital literacy, access to robotics, and computational thinking, between others. Hence, this review and meta-analysis aim at identifying the influence of robotics activities on computational thinking through a PRISMA-guided review. The findings reveal that interventions conducted in early childhood education significantly impact computational thinking. Results also showcase that, despite perceived barriers related to technology accessibility, the presence of legislation and contexts prioritizing these competencies is more relevant than the digital access gap.

AB  - Since computational thinking is a high-level cognitive skill and its conceptual framework has not yet been clarified, the assessment of this skill is problematic. While there is no consensus in the literature about the components of computational thinking, the abstraction component is located at a point where opinions intersect. In addition, it is predicted that computer science unplugged activities will improve computational thinking, and there is limited research examining this effect. As a result, this research aims to demonstrate the alleged effects of computer science unplugged activities on abstraction skill which is considered the critical component of computational thinking. The study, which was planned with a mixed methods research design, lasted 8 weeks. Quantitative data were obtained from the abstraction skill test developed by the researchers, while qualitative data were obtained from observations and task- based interviews after each activity. Quantitative findings showed that computer science unplugged activities significantly improve abstraction skills and thus computational thinking. Qualitative findings not only revealed that developments in the six abstracting steps caused this significant difference but also identified abstracting steps where the effect of each activity was limited. Suggestions for organizing activities to improve these steps are given. Finally, suggestions are presented for the conceptual framework of computational thinking based on abstraction.

AB  - The healthy development of cognitive functions, including executive functions, has been shown to depend mainly on the experiences and learning opportunities of people, especially during childhood. Over the past few years, researchers have been studying the impacts of diverse types of interventions on children’s cognitive development in which computational thinking programs are a recent field. This pilot study evaluated the effect of computational thinking training based on the “Programming for Children” program on the executive functions of children aged 10 and 11 years: working memory, inhibition, and planning (N = 30). The results showed that children in the experimental group improved on tests of visuospatial working memory, cognitive inhibition, and sequential planning compared with the control group. However, tests of verbal working memory, memory strategy, and visual spatial planning did not show any observed changes. Although this was an exploratory study, and its findings should be interpreted cautiously due to the small sample size, the findings support the relevance and feasibility of conducting similar larger studies with larger samples.

AB  - Computational thinking has been promoted as an impactful 21st-century skillset that can be transferred to many other disciplines and problem scenarios. With the proliferation of age-appropriate coding platforms for young children, computational thinking has become increasingly popular in early childhood settings. However, there is a lack of research on introducing coding and computational thinking to teacher training in early childhood education. To empower early childhood teachers in the digital society, this study introduced 17 early childhood teachers to robot programming and computational thinking through the ‘CT4ECE’ professional development program, which includes three phases: Learn, Practice, and Reflect & Improve. Results of pre- and post-intervention surveys revealed that the CT4ECE program significantly enhanced teachers' robotics and pedagogical knowledge, as well as their attitudes towards computational thinking, especially their interest in and their view of using computational thinking in classroom practice. Post-intervention interviews indicated that participation in CT4ECE helped educators gain a basic understanding of both coding robots and computational thinking suitable for young children due to a structured change process for teachers' professional learning. This study establishes a strong foundation for enhancing and expanding the CT4ECE program, ultimately equipping teachers and children with the necessary skillsets to thrive in the digital future.

AB  - The purpose of the current study is to investigate the effects of the unplugged computational thinking (CT) integrated STEM (UCT-STEM) approach and STEM approach on early childhood pre-service teachers’ CT skills (creativity, algorithmic thinking, critical thinking, problem solving, cooperativity, communication). The study was conducted with a total of 70 early childhood pre-service teachers. Quasi-experimental design was used; activities based on the UCT-STEM approach were administered to the experimental group and activities based on the STEM approach were administered to the control group. Post-test scores for CT skills showed a statistically significant difference in favour of the experimental group. It was concluded that the UCT-STEM approach was more effective in developing the pre-service teachers’ CT skills than the STEM approach. The current study presents an important finding to the literature in terms of the developed STEM and UCT-STEM contents and how these contents improve pre-service teachers’ CT skills. The STEM and UCT-STEM content provides significant information in terms of teacher practices. At the same time, this study offers important implications for program developers and policy-makers to integrate these innovative educational approaches into both early childhood education and teacher education programs.

AB  - The integration of computational thinking (CT) to enhance creativity in design students has often been underexplored in design education. While design thinking has traditionally been the cornerstone of university design pedagogy and remains essential, the increasing role of digital tools and artificial intelligence in modern design practices presents new opportunities for innovation. By introducing CT alongside design thinking, students can expand their creative toolkit and engage with emerging technologies more effectively. Although many design students may have limited experience with programming, incorporating accessible, no-code tools can help them confidently embrace computational methods, unlocking new pathways for creative exploration and innovation. This study proposes an alternative approach to improve the motivation of design students by introducing machine learning tools into product design processes. We developed an experimental pedagogy in which 56 industrial design university students learned how to use Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (Weka), a machine learning tool, for three hours of design work a week, for a total of eight weeks. Our covariate analysis of data collected in the pretest and posttest shows that the general learning motivations in the group using Weka are significantly higher than those in the group without Weka. However, no significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of learning strategies, collaboration, or critical thinking. Students using Weka spent more time focusing on model training and tended to improve their algorithmic thinking, and the introduction of Weka appeared to enhance their motivation to learn. On the other hand, these students might have been focusing on working individually at their computers, potentially neglecting communication and collaboration. The findings suggest that teaching machine learning applications without requiring coding has the potential to boost design students' motivation to engage with CT skills, though care must be taken to maintain collaborative practices.

AB  - There is increasing effort to integrate Computational Thinking (CT) curricula across all education levels. Therefore, research on CT assessment has lately progressed towards developing and validating reliable CT assessment tools, which are crucial for evaluating students' potential learning progress and thus the effectiveness of suggested curricular programs. Several CT assessment tools were developed for elementary, high-school, and university students over the last years. Moreover, associations between CT scores and other cognitive abilities were unraveled. However, studies on the topic in primary school level are scarce. Like the general concept of intelligence, CT remains broadly defined as the ability to combine algorithmic operations to form complex solutions in order to solve problems effectively, utilizing concepts of computer science with or without the use of computers. In this study, we aimed at specifying a cognitive definition of CT, focusing on the under-investigated population of primary school children. Since validated assessment tools for this age group were not available, we adapted a validated CT test, which was initially designed for middle school students. In our study participated 192 third and fourth graders. The analyses revealed promising results on the reliability of the adapted CT assessment for primary school students. Moreover, findings indicated CT's positive associations with i. complex numerical abilities, ii. verbal reasoning abilities, and iii. non-verbal visuospatial abilities. Our results indicate similarities but also differences in associations of CT with other cognitive abilities in primary school children compared to other age groups. In summary: i. numerical abilities seem to associate with CT at the primary school level, whereas this seems not the case later on in education, ii. verbal abilities seem to associate with CT both along primary and secondary education levels, and iii. non-verbal reasoning abilities seem to associate with CT from primary education level to the university level and beyond. These differences imply that several basic cognitive abilities support CT abilities and CT development differentially across ages.

AB  - The concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI), born as the possibility of simulating the human brain's learning capabilities, quickly evolves into one of the educational technology concepts that provide tools for students to better themselves in a plethora of areas. Unlike the previous educational technology iterations, which are limited to instrumental use for providing platforms to build learning applications, AI has proposed a unique education laboratory by enabling students to explore an instrument that functions as a dynamic system of computational concepts. However, the extent of the implications of AI adaptation in modern education is yet to be explored. Motivated to fill the literature gap and to consider the emerging significance of AI in education, this paper aims to analyze the possible intertwined relationship between students’ intrinsic motivation for learning Artificial Intelligence during the COVID-19 pandemic; the relationship between students’ computational thinking and understanding of AI concepts; and the underlying dynamic relation, if existing, between AI and computational thinking building efforts. To investigate the mentioned relationships, the present empirical study employs mediation analysis based upon collected 137 survey data from Universidad Politécnica de Madrid students in the Institute for Educational Science and the School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering during the first quarter of 2022. Findings show that intrinsic motivation mediates the relationship between perceived Artificial Intelligence learning and computational thinking. Also, the research indicates that intrinsic motivation has a significant relationship with computational thinking and perceived Artificial Intelligence learning.

AB  - Computational thinking is widely recognized as an essential skill for adapting to the current era, with programming learning being the most effective means to develop it. It is recommended that computational thinking and learning programming be introduced as early as elementary school. However, elementary school students often possess limited prior knowledge of programming, posing challenges in their learning process. The graphic organizers (GOs) may serve as a bridge between students’ existing knowledge and new learning, facilitating a deeper processing of the overall information and thereby enhancing the learning process. This can be particularly advantageous for early-stage learners when grappling with difficult subjects. Consequently, this study employed GOs to assist elementary school students in their computational thinking and programming learning, employing a quasi-experiment design to evaluate their effectiveness. The results showed that although all students demonstrated awareness of applying computational thinking to solve problems, those exposed to GO-based instruction exhibited higher levels of computational thinking, programming skills, and flow experiences.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) practices is a critical cognitive tool for students to overcome challenges in this technological era. Few studies investigated CT practices from a development perspective. A two-year intervention was implemented in 30 intervention and 22 control schools in Hong Kong to promote CT education (T1baseline: N = 13,056; T2: N = 16,367; and T3: N = 15,269). Senior primary students (grades 4 to 6) around 8–12 years old were targeted. Among them, 34% were girls at T1baseline. Their learning progression of cognitive development was assessed with a CT practices test. Data were analyzed using item response analysis. Learning trajectories of CT practices were modeled to understand how students’ cognitive development differed between schools. Insights of findings were discussed in bringing CT practices to life.

AB  - Engagement is critical to computational thinking and programming education. However, as multi-dimensional variables, when analyzing how different aspects of engagement in computational thinking tasks influence skills development, it becomes crucial to discern precisely which engagement components intersect with the progression of computational thinking skills. This discernment is pivotal because engagement can vary based on the task nature, the context, and the individual's preferences. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the gender differences in engagement and computational thinking skills and the predictive relationships among these sub-dimensions for boys and girls in an unplugged environment. In this study, a quasi-experiment for 90 sixth-grade students from a north Chinese primary school was performed. By partial least squares–structural equation modeling, students’ models of computational thinking skills and engagement were analyzed, and comparisons of boys and girls were made by analysis of covariance statistics. Results indicated that compared with boys, girls reported higher computational thinking performance and more engagement in unplugged contexts. Furthermore, girls’ computational thinking skills were only predicted by their cognitive engagement, whereas boys’ computational thinking skills were predicted by their behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement. Teachers can adopt these findings to design computational thinking teaching interventions that combine the advantages of unplugged activity and focus on the engagement of boys and girls.

AB  - In this work, we argue for expanding the scope of K-12 computational thinking (CT) integration contexts to include everyday scenarios involving moral reasoning. Epistemic overlap between computational thinking practices and moral reasoning suggest that these contexts are potentially rich sites to see “seeds of CT” in children's reasoning and can provide rich educational pathways for children into CT. Taking a case-study approach, we examine the reasoning of a second-grader, Ollie, on a task involving fair allocation of resources to victims of a natural disaster. Our analysis finds that Ollie's reasoning was rich with seeds of CT (e.g., problem formulation, abstraction, complex-systems thinking) and that empathy served as an important supporting role to the CT. This work has implications for curricular design, suggesting that fairness and resource allocation scenarios with built-in opportunities for empathy might provide rich sandboxes for CT integration.

AB  - Although there are different definitions for computational thinking in the literature, it is possible to define it mainly as problem solving, designing and interpreting new systems by thinking like a computer. According to Wing (2006), computational thinking is a way of designing a system and understanding human behaviors by focusing on the basic concepts of the computer sciences. The recent focus on computational thinking as a key 21 st century skill for all students has led to a number of curriculum initiatives to embed it in K-12 classrooms and to introduce computing ideas to students early during their schooling years. The present study aims to explore the effects of a short, intensive coding and robotics training on the computational thinking skill self-efficacy of middle school students. 24 fifth graders participated in the study and data were collected by means of the Computational Thinking Self-efficacy scale (CTS) and one open-ended question. Analyses of the pre, post and delayed tests revealed significant differences between the pre and post-tests.

AB  - Methodological innovations across social sciences are opening new avenues for conducting research designed to address real-world challenges. The benefits of utilizing the Design-Based Implementation Research (DBIR) approach in public libraries to resolve a persistent problem of practice, a lack of assessment tools to evaluate youth Computational Thinking (CT) programs, is demonstrated. Findings from a three-year, three-phased study utilizing the DBIR approach to design and implement a suite of assessment tools to assess CT programming in public libraries are presented. Guided by the four principles of the DBIR approach, this research produced new knowledge, including identifying CT program outcomes, challenges, and recommendations for designing and implementing assessment tools to measure the impact of public libraries' CT programming. Findings underscore the DBIR approach as a strategy for engaging with practitioners and helping shift their perspectives by resolving practice problems and facilitating the design of sustainable solutions.

AB  - Although there is controversy surrounding rewards and competition in education, they are key elements in digital game-based learning (DGBL). Research on the influence of rewards and competition in DGBL often yields mixed results, suggesting a need to investigate individual game elements and their interactions. This study implemented DGBL focusing on computational thinking (CT) in 7th-grade classes. Both quantitative and behavioral data were collected to understand the impact of rewards (power-up or customization) and competition (with or without) on students’ intrinsic motivation, game performance, behaviors, and CT skills. The findings uncovered significant interactions between rewards and competition. Students with both competition and power-up rewards achieved the highest game points but the lowest CT performance, whereas those exposed to the same power-up rewards without competition attained the lowest game points but the best CT performance. Implications are drawn for DGBL research and practice.

AB  - Despite growing interest in early childhood computational thinking (CT), there is a lack of validated assessments for children who are emerging readers. This paper presents validity and reliability evidence of a performance-based assessment of CT using item response theory (IRT) from 272 children aged 4–8. Using a two-parameter logistic model IRT model (2PL IRT), we confirmed that model- and item-level fits are acceptable. Item analyses revealed a high discriminability (M = 2.26, SD = 1.12) and a moderate item difficulty (M = −0.21; SD = 0.86), on average, across 19 items. Reliability analysis demonstrated that the assessment was substantially reliable (marginal reliability: rxx = 0.87). Differential item functioning (DIF) analyses indicated that the assessment estimated children's item parameters fairly, regardless of their gender and age. However, we confirmed gaps in latent ability (θ) of CT by gender and age: boys showed higher latent ability of CT than girls, and old children (above 72 months) showed higher latent ability than young children (below 72 months). Findings suggest the assessment is a fair measure that can serve as a reliable and valid tool to assess CT for children who are emerging readers.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is an important and essential skill for human beings to master in the 21st century. Although CT has received wide attention since this concept was proposed, the current theoretical models have not well defined the complex relations between CT and other cognitive abilities for young children. To provide insight into this gap, the current study proposed a model in which we hypothesized that CT was significantly related to arithmetic fluency that is viewed as an important domain of mathematics. Additionally, arithmetic fluency was predicted to mediate the relations of CT to other cognitive abilities, including reasoning and creativity. This study tested such direct and indirect relations in children aged 5–6 years. Consistent with previous studies on older age groups, the results showed that CT and arithmetic fluency were significantly related to each other and both were significantly related to reasoning ability and creative thinking as well. Moreover, this study, for the first time, indicated that arithmetic fluency totally mediated the relation between CT and reasoning ability, suggesting that these concepts share conceptual commonalities, such as the cognitive processes related to mathematics or/and abstraction; in contrast, arithmetic fluency did not mediate the relation between CT and creative thinking, suggesting that gaining CT skill may exert direct positive effect on the development of creativity. Therefore, despite the root in computer science, CT is associated with many cognitive and learning abilities in other domains, supporting the importance of including CT into early school education.

AB  - There has been growing interest in assessing computational thinking (CT) across diverse learners beyond the traditional forms of tests and assignments. Learning games offer the potential for innovative, stealth assessments of students' implicit learning from gameplay behaviors. This paper reports on the measurement of implicit CT practices demonstrated by upper elementary- and middle-school students as they play the CT learning game Zoombinis. The process of using the gameplay log data to build valid automated detectors of students' implicit CT practices is discussed. Findings from this study provide implications for analyzing gameplay behaviors at scale, leading to the development of models for the assessment of implicit STEM learning.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is critical for Twenty-first century life. Ensuring equitable access to CT depends on preparing teachers to integrate CT into disciplinary curricula. We report on the design, evaluation, and outcomes of the Computational Thinking Unplugged for Science (CT-UP-S) professional development program for inservice science teachers. Our process-based approach to CT significantly improved teachers CT understanding and CT/science integration self-efficacy by systematically linking CT practices to scaffold the generation of unplugged algorithms. Additionally, we found that the process-based approach provided a framework for teachers' lesson planning and that teachers’ content knowledge moderated their ability to write CT-integrated science lessons.

AB  - Early evidence suggests that robot programming offers an important foundation for spatial reasoning and computational thinking; however, researchers have debated how to introduce young children to these skills. We explored how preschoolers develop understanding of spatial concepts and computational thinking as the children took turns navigating a path during guided play with a programmable robot. Our analysis of the data included a multimodal visualization of the exchanges between the teacher, children, and a programmable robotic device. The findings highlight the effects that arose from the physical-digital convergence of technology integrated into play including: (a) the robot evoked a chain of actions, enacting pedagogic forces that transformed children's learning; (b) children used their own bodies as spatial referents, co-locating themselves in space with the robot; (c) the teacher remained a key actor, providing verbal and nonverbal scaffolding to promote children's understanding and mastery of spatial and computational concepts; and (d) talking with the teacher about spatial concepts combined with the interactions with the robot enhanced children's acquisition of spatial ideas relative to the quantity of children's verbal expressions and complexity of their applied spatial skills and computational thinking.

AB  - Workers in the areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics play a significant role in the sustained growth and stability of the global economy, and, thus constitute a critical component in helping all countries worldwide to prosper. In this context, computational thinking constitutes an important skill to have as it enables workers to develop creative solutions to complex problems. Nonetheless, across all economies worldwide, there is a need to have more workers who are able to think through problems, challenges, and solutions in computational terms. It is thus of utmost importance to integrate the teaching of computational thinking in K-12 education in order to reduce the skills gap between education and the workplace. A pertinent and crucial question that arises is whether teachers have the knowledge and skills to teach students how to think computationally. Existing research shows that teacher education departments do not currently have the knowledge to promote computational thinking in their programs. The present study focuses on two aspects of computational thinking, such as, algorithmic thinking and debugging skills with the use of scaffolded programming scripts in an educational technology undergraduate course. The results show statistically significant learning gains in pre-service teachers’ algorithmic thinking and debugging skills in the context of robotic programming activities with LEGO WeDo. Limitations and future research directions are discussed.

AB  - Recent studies identify Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) as a key factor in enhancing cognitive development, particularly within Computational Thinking (CT) literature. However, research gaps remain in understanding how SRL and CT interact from a developmental perspective. Our study designed a program with tailored animations and worksheets to specifically foster students' learning and cognitive development. Using a mixed-methods approach, we administered surveys among 1235 students from 29 Hong Kong primary schools to investigate a dynamic learning system comprising SRL and CT in a large-scale CT program. Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 students to further probe insights. Quantitative findings revealed a mutually reinforcing relationship in the dynamic system, suggesting that higher SRL skills enhance cognitive CT abilities, and vice versa. Complementing these results, qualitative findings showed that integrating animations and worksheets into the CT program significantly boosted students' SRL and cognitive development. These findings have significant implications for educational practices and curriculum design. Schools should consider implementing SRL strategies, such as proactive goal setting and reflective evaluation, within their curricula to promote students’ cognitive development. Furthermore, strategic investments in educational technology, including collaborations with EdTech developers, are essential to create effective, pedagogically sound tools that enhance learning outcomes. These insights provide valuable guidance for creating a supportive SRL environment that fosters cognitive development in primary school education.

AB  - In recent years, there has been increasing interest in integrating Computational Thinking (CT) into elementary schools. However, few studies have focused on teachers’ perceptions. This study aims to examine teachers' perceptions to bridge the gap between theory and practice. The study analysed teachers’ perceptions of integrating CT into school subjects through the constructionist approach, using Scratch a leading programming platform inspired by Resnick's Lifelong Kindergarten Constructionist model. Over a school year, 31 teachers participated in a professional development program and applied this model in their classrooms. The teachers were interviewed to capture their perceptions of learning and teaching using a constructionist method. The findings revealed that teachers with creative arts experience fully embraced the model, while others partially adopted it. Teachers recognized the benefits of constructionist teaching in fostering creativity, motivation, and engagement among students. However, they struggled with balancing these benefits with school demands and constraints. Challenges included managing time effectively within constraints of school and ensuring curriculum alignment. Despite this, many teachers found that the constructionist approach positively impacted students' learning engagement and personal development. By addressing the identified challenges, teacher education designers, curriculum developers, and schools can develop practices for closing the gap between theory and practice.

AB  - Educational research on predicting learners’ computer programming performance has yielded practical implications that guide task designs in computer education. There have been attempts to investigate learners’ computer programming patterns using high-frequency and automated data collection. This approach can be considered as process-based analysis as opposed to outcome-based analysis (i.e., the use of test or exam scores). In this process-based approach to investigate learners’ computer programming process, we included two critical constructs in our research, self-regulated learning and computational thinking skills. We aimed to identify learners’ computer programming patterns in the context that novice students learn a computer programming language, Python, in an online coding environment. We examined the relationships between the learners’ coding patterns, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills. Initially, we adopted a traditional approach with the aggregate data of learners’ computer programming behaviors. We then utilized a computational analytics approach to learner performance, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills, with ever-changing computer programming patterns. In our initial approach, the indicators of aggregate computer programming data were not associated with learners' learning performance and computational thinking skills. In the computational analysis approach, many indicators revealed significant differences between the identified patterns regarding computational thinking skills and self-regulated learning. Recommendations about the use of programming log data analysis methods and future scaffolding for computer programming learners are addressed.

AB  - In the field of education, research has consistently emphasized mathematical creative thinking as a crucial component of 21st-century skills. Thus, this cross-sectional study examines the predictors of such thinking by specifically focusing on the roles of perceived creativity, creative self-efficacy, and computational thinking. The participants consisted of 896 secondary school students (52.9 % female; 47.1 % male) in Indonesia who were asked to complete a series of online questionnaires and tests. For analysis, structural equation modeling was employed, demonstrating satisfactory construct validity and instrument reliability. Based on the results, there was a positive association between computational thinking and mathematical creative thinking. In addition, perceived creativity had a positive impact on mathematical creative thinking, whereas creative self-efficacy showed a negative association. As for the empirical model, it revealed that computational thinking plays a mediating role, connecting perceived creativity and creative self-efficacy to mathematical creative thinking. The findings suggest that incorporating these skills and related variables into the mathematics curriculums in schools is essential for preparing students for success in the 21st century.

AB  - Previous studies have explored the relationship between computational thinking (CT) and creativity. However, a consensus has yet to be reached since both CT and creativity varied in ideation and assessment. To uncover the cognitive mechanism underlying the interplay between CT and creativity, we conduct a scoping review of 26 empirical studies published in 2006–2024. Our findings suggested that the effects of working memory varied in the interplay between CT and creativity due to differences in age range, neural network activation regions, and measurements. Intellectual abilities, including algorithmic fluency, reasoning ability, and coding ability, showed cognitive transfer effect on CT skills but not necessarily on creativity, suggesting that cognitive abilities embracing more intelligent elements may contribute to the functional connectivity in CT neural networks but only partly overlapped with creativity involved networks. Although executive functions (working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control) play a crucial role in both CT and creativity, their contributions to the CT-creativity interplay are still rarely studied. Future research should explore the CT-creativity relationship from the perspective of neuroscience.

Sixty-six papers were selected for this systematic review and analyzed for patterns in relation to the implementation of CS education in K-12 schools and its impact on the development of students’ CT skills. Although educational interventions have not always been successful in CS education, this review provides strong evidence that overall, CS education promotes the development of students’ CT in the K-12 setting while improving their creative and critical thinking skills. We recommend early access to CS education, various innovative instructional approaches to CS education and appropriate support and guidance for student learning.

AB  - Recently, the development of computational thinking (CT) skills has become widespread in the whole world. There is a consensus to develop students’ CT skills through unplugged and plugged-in programming. However, the choice of programming approaches taught in schools is arbitrary and few studies have compared the effectiveness differences between unplugged and plugged-in programming. This study aimed to explore the differences between unplugged and plugged-in programming in developing CT skills of students in Grades 1-2 students. It also explored the joint effects of students’ gender, programming experience, programming interest, and programming confidence with different programming approaches on CT skills. The quasi-experimental research approach was used to conduct 10 weeks of unplugged, plugged-in, and regular programming activities with 124 Grades 1-2 students. The results found that unplugged programming promoted CT skills more in the early primary grades than plugged-in programming. We found that boys and students with programming experience in unplugged group performed significantly better in CT skills than in plugged-in group. Moreover, the improvement of CT skills of students in unplugged group was positively correlated with the level of their programming interest and programming confidence. However, these were not observed in plugged-in group. The results of this study can provide precise guidance for teaching CT skills to early primary school students and provide references for CT education.

We identify emerging patterns through which they engaged in what we refer to as narrative computational thinking. The latter describes broadened aspects of narrative literacy practices that are linked to computational thinking. By applying a multicase study approach and through various vignettes, we illustrate how children applied computational thinking to understand and influence the narrative possibilities offered by the different tools. Our results illustrate circumstances under which digital storytelling activities provide a favorable basis for narrative computational thinking, and that when computational thinking functions as a scaffold for story creation, it encourages a blend of creativity and computational thinking, providing a compelling approach to introducing emerging digital literacies to young children in a narrative context.

AB  - In this study, it is aimed to identify the computational thinking skills used by gifted and talented students in integrated STEM activities based on the EDP. The case study design, a qualitative research method, is employed in the study. The participants consist of gifted and talented students attending the Science and Arts Center. Integrated STEM activities based on the EDP were conducted over the course of ten weeks and among these activities, robotic and 3D modeling-based robot construction activities using Lego sets are addressed in the present study. The STEM activity booklet, researchers' fieldnotes, and teaching process video recordings were used as data collection tools in the study. Data that was collected was analyzed through content analysis. It was seen that gifted and talented students participating in integrated STEM activities based on the EDP make active use of critical thinking skills while providing explanations, making associations, questioning information, giving justifications, solving problems, thinking creatively, making generalizations, and attempting to convince others; as for the instances of defining problems, creating solutions, and evaluating the effectiveness of the solution, the students were observed to actively use their problem-solving skills. The detailed account provided by the study on the way robotic and 3D robot modeling activities improve the computational thinking skills of gifted and talented students contributes to the required educational support and to the existing body of literature.

AB  - In the artificial intelligence age, cultivating young children's computational thinking (CT) has sparked tremendous attention. Programmable robotics is a developmental-appropriate and screen-free means that provides young children with great opportunities to learn programming and develop CT. However, it is reported that young children might have difficulties learning abstract CT concepts. As a helpful pedagogical facilitator, metaphors can help turn abstract concepts into more concrete and clear concepts that learners are familiar with. Therefore, this research proposed a metaphor-based robot programming (MRP) approach and explored its impact on young children's CT and behavioral patterns. A total of 118 children aged 5–6 were recruited in this experiment with two conditions: the experimental group adopted the metaphor-based robot programming (MRP) approach while the control group used the conventional robot programming (CRP) approach. Results revealed that children who adopted the MRP approach outperformed children who adopted the CRP approach on CT. In addition, behavioral analysis indicated that the proposed MRP approach could facilitate children's superior learning performance and more positive learning behaviors, so as to help them achieve learning objectives. Accordingly, this study can provide insightful guidance and inspiration for future research on effective programming teaching and CT development for young children.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is a necessary skill for students. It is as important as the other essential skills such as reading, writing, and arithmetic. However, how to improve students’ CT in robotics is still to be explored. Hence, this study examined the effects of computer supported project-based learning (CSPBL) on students’ CT and learning engagement through comparing students’ CT and engagement in two courses instructed by the same instructor (one instructed with a traditional method, the other instructed with CSPBL). Participants were seventy-nine students from a university in China. Questionnaires, interviews, and project analysis were used to measure students’ CT and learning engagement. The comparative results of self-reports and final projects indicated that the CSPBL enhanced students’ CT. The simulation project training based on the SenseStudy learning platform in CSPBL helped students debug the programming code, optimize the algorithm design, and improve their algorithmic thinking, cooperation, and problem solving during the program error correction. The CSPBL also improved students’ engagement in learning, especially for those with more than one year of programming experience. It was found that the CSPBL was effective in terms of improving students’ CT and engagement in robotics learning. This study provides teachers with practical suggestions to conduct effective robotics instruction.

AB  - Malaysia has introduced computational thinking skills as part of a curriculum integration update to meet the global trends in 21st-century education, focusing on empowering digital literacy. Nevertheless, a preliminary investigation revealed an apparent lack of understanding of computational thinking skills in general among teachers. The study explores the feasibility of developing a localized E-learning system to train computational thinking skills among teachers. An E-learning system, termed as myCTGWBL, was developed on the basis of a newly proposed conceptual framework to present computational thinking teaching–learning repertoire to the teachers. The hypothesis is that myCTGWBL would develop teachers' computational thinking and its position in teaching–learning understanding. myCTGWBL relevance was tested through DeLone and McLean's information system and Urbach's collaboration quality construct. To determine the success factors, partial least squares structural equation modeling was used. A total of 369 teachers participated in a two-stage survey. Participants' understanding of computational thinking and perceptions were recorded at the pre- and post-intervention phases. Open-ended questions of the surveys were analyzed using a simple text analysis technique. The closed-ended questions surveys were analyzed using SPSS Statistics 22.0. A significant improvement in teachers' computational thinking teaching–learning repertoire in a relatively short period has been recorded. Teachers also demonstrated increased confidence in the future delivering computational thinking-based lessons. The E-learning conceptual framework has illustrated the predictive power between user intent, user satisfaction, and Computational thinking (CT) knowledge benefits. Results demonstrate that myCTGWBL could be used to guide future planning when establishing CT knowledge acquisition initiatives, particularly among teachers.

AB  - Efforts to incorporate computational thinking (CT) into academic courses have been gaining popularity. CT is a problem-solving skill that is crucial in the 21st century. CT may be used to support language education. Courses in English as a foreign language often need an effective writing component that includes writing organization and language use, as demonstrated by the poor writing samples often generated by students of these courses. To address the problems, CT, which is a higher-order mode of problem-solving and knowledge acquisition optimization, was used. The experimental group was instructed using the CT teaching model based on CT's essential components (decomposition, generalization, abstraction, algorithm, and evaluation), whereas the control group was taught using the conventional method. In total, 58 undergraduate students divided into two groups participated in this study. A combination of writing, CT skills, surveys, and interviews were used to collect data according to an experimental design. The collected quantitative data were analyzed through analysis of covariance and structural equation modeling, and the MAXQDA 2022software was used to analyze the collected qualitative data. The results of this study indicate that incorporating CT into an English writing course enhances the writing and higher-order thinking skills of students. The CT concepts helps students develop critical thinking skills by evaluating the text and identifying potential issues or improvements. Additionally, it allows students to use their skills to create unique writing solutions, which can boost English writing creativity.

AB  - Computational thinking education has become an increasingly popular topic among practitioners and researchers. However, rare is known how to effectively teach and learn computational thinking in early childhood education. To address this knowledge gap, this systematic review examined 26 studies on the teaching and learning of computational thinking in early childhood education from 2010 to 2022. The content knowledge, tools, pedagogical design, assessment methods, and learning outcomes were analyzed. Results indicated that, with age-appropriate instructional design, children could develop early concepts and skills of computational thinking, as well as other related skills such as communication, collaboration, and problem solving. Across the studies, we found that most studies used quantitative research methods, with direct assessment and observation being the most. Several challenges were identified: (1) achieving a deeper learning of computational thinking; (2) a lack of valid and reliable computational thinking assessments for children with a wider age range; (3) selecting appropriate learning tools; and (4) designing age-appropriate activities for young learners. Although with these challenges, computational thinking education could bring new learning opportunities and enhance children's computational thinking skills, as well as other non-cognitive skills such as critical thinking, body-material interaction, and hand-eye coordination. This systematic review informs future endeavors in theorizing a digital learning framework that can integrate computational thinking into early childhood education.

AB  - Teacher competencies encompass the dimensions of knowledge and attitudes, yet few studies have analysed teachers' latent profiles in relation to the interaction between these two dimensions. Latent profile analysis, which examines the interplay between variables to distinguish subgroups of individuals, has recently emerged in studies of computational thinking (CT) as a method for identifying student profiles. However, the latent profiles of CT teachers have not yet been analysed. We therefore analysed the latent profiles of a sample of 493 teachers who had participated in a teacher development programme in CT, according to their knowledge and perceived usefulness of CT. Three profiles were identified: (1) highly knowledgeable with high perceived usefulness, (2) knowledgeable with low perceived usefulness, and (3) less knowledgeable with low perceived usefulness. Qualitative data further triangulated these findings. We also examined the learning achievement of 12,105 students taught by these teachers. Students taught by highly knowledgeable teachers with a high perceived sense of usefulness demonstrated significantly better achievement than their peers. Our findings highlight the importance of nurturing both knowledge of and perceived usefulness in CT. They also provide valuable insights for similar teacher development programmes, emphasizing the importance of peer mentoring support for less knowledgeable teachers. Additionally, we underscore the value of having teachers create artefacts using CT for instructional purposes, allowing them to gain firsthand experience of its usefulness. As few studies have explored teachers' latent profiles based on the dimensions of knowledge and attitudes, the contribution of this study extends beyond the domain of CT.

AB  - We designed a controlled trial protocol that seeks to contribute to cognitive science by studying the effect of thought training on children's executive functions. The study design is a cluster randomized controlled trial, with intra-subject and inter-subject evaluation, with two parallel groups: an experimental group and a TAU control group. With three measures, pre-test, post-test, and follow-up after three months. The participants will be children aged 9 to 11. The allocation will be randomized by groups and not individually. The sample will be a minimum of 44 participants. The primary measures will be neuropsychological tests to assess executive functions. Secondary measures will be a computational thinking test, neuropsychological tests to assess metacognition and attention, and an acceptability scale. The experimental group will participate in the COGNI-MACHINE computational thinking training designed by the first author. The training frequency will be twice a week in 60 min sessions for 12 weeks. The TAU control group will receive computer science classes as usual during the same time as the experimental group. The evaluators taking the measurements will be blinded to the assignment. The investigators in charge of the intervention will be blinded to the results of the evaluations.

AB  - Negative feedback can temporarily relieve negative Chinese transfer (NCT) in English as a foreign language (EFL) syntactic writing by focusing only on the surface writing constructs, neglecting that EFL writing is an embodiment of the process by which higher-order thinking operates. To solve the problem, the researchers conducted a pretest, interventionist group dynamic assessment (IGDA) in the form of negative feedback based on computational thinking (CT), higher-order thinking, and post-test quasi-experimental design, with a control group receiving the direct correction feedback instructing model to mitigate the NCT in EFL syntactic writing. We analyzed the syntactic writing types and frequencies of the NCT obtained through repeated-measure ANOVA and confirmed by qualitative data through video recording. The results indicated that IGDA in the form of negative feedback based on CT principal skills could (1) significantly decrease syntactic writing errors caused by the NCT, (2) improve learners’ EFL writing performance, and finally, (3) elevate the computer as an essential mediation tool. This innovative instructing mode of intervening with writing constructs and higher-order thinking and bringing about deeper thinking and creativity contributes to the EFL writing teaching methodology in a foreign language higher education.

AB  - The tenure system in the United States places significant importance on teaching effectiveness. To date, students' evaluations of teaching (SETs) have been the reigning mechanism for assessing effective teaching. However, prior work has shown that SETs are often biased against underrepresented groups and minorities. The present study analyzes options for effective teaching assessments, which include evaluating final grades and measuring the differences between students’ pre- and post-tests (normalized gain) using standard instruments. The content area and the instrument used in this study originated in the computational thinking field, which has a widespread presence in engineering, where minorities are at a disadvantage. This study obtained a total of 88 student participants from four sections of an introductory engineering course at a Southwestern institution. The study utilized a computational thinking diagnostic (CTD) to inform the course teaching approach (the intervention). Results show that (a) normalized learning gains correlated moderately with SETs, (b) final grades correlated strongly with SETs, (c) final grades correlated strongly with normalized learning gains, (d) the educational intervention based on the CTD significantly affected student learning, and (e) SET comments affect evaluations. The implications include the notion that standardized instrument-driven instruction and evaluations can increase the success of minorities on both sides of the classroom. The purpose of this manuscript is to invite the Heliyon readership to get involved in the development of related instruments and to incorporate these measures of learning into their instruction so biases are avoided or minimized.

AB  - In the digital age, our lives become more dependent on technology, yet the digital gap is intensifying especially because most people lack digital literacy. As a modest step to handle this challenge, we designed a course named "Play with me in Code" to develop pre-service teachers' (PSTs) thinking skills and expose them to learning by creation using computational thinking and programming as part of the constructionism paradigm. The added value of using Scratch in the context of teacher education lies not only in familiarity with a programming language but with an emphasis on experiencing self-directed learning tackling with problem solving situations, creativity, socioemotional competencies, and logical computational thinking. The present study aims to examine 25 PSTs' attitudes towards facing challenges of coding with Scratch. To this end, a mixed-method approach was activated by using questionnaires, blog posts, and reflections. Findings revealed that the learning environment encouraged PSTs' use of abstraction and decomposition to address a complex problem or to design a complex game. Study's conclusions relate to the importance of providing PSTs opportunities to experience learning by programming for raising their awareness of the importance of enhancing thinking skills and creativity in the future.

AB  - Using the analytical tool CiteSpace, this review study conducted a bibliometric analysis of the characteristics of 249 studies on Computational Thinking (CT) indexed in the Web of Science from 2012 to 2021. The multi-dimensional analytical approach provided a holistic view of the scope of CT research and its progression,and enabled the major topics, themes, disciplinary domains, and prominent authors, institutes, countries/regions, and papers to be identified. Based on the general descriptive data analysis, the results showed that CT has gained increasing influence as a field of research over the past decade. A clustering analysis of the retrieved keywords showed that the development of CT in K-12 education was the most frequently discussed topic. The co-occurrence knowledge maps identified the 11 main research themes and their progress. The research was from a wide spectrum of disciplines including education, science education, computer science, interdisciplinary application, psychology, engineering, and information systems. The highest co-citations were found in the journals of Communication of the ACM, Computers and Education, and Computers in Human Behaviors. The researchers, institutes, and countries/regions that have made the most significant contributions to CT research and the 10 most highly cited CT studies were also identified. Overall, the findings of this review study indicate the paths for future research on developing CT in the classroom.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT), a way to think about solving problems, is recognized as a basic skill for the 21st century. Although game-based learning (GBL) has been shown to improve student's CT skills, students may fail to self-evaluate or debate as they play games, thus failing to develop higher-order thinking. Also not widely explored is how teachers are to practice the CT core competencies during the learning process to cultivate students' problem-solving thinking. As the adoption of student-generated questions (SGQ) is an instructional strategy to promote higher-order thinking, we develop a GBL platform that uses this strategy to enhance students' CT skills, learning motivation, and learning confidence. For this purpose, fifty-three primary school students were recruited for this study, and data were collected during four classes of experimental CT activities. This study shows that the experimental group using the SGQ strategy with a GBL platform exhibited significantly higher CT skills than the control group. In addition, with respect to learning motivation and learning confidence it is found that the experimental group also outperformed the control group. This confirms that integrating the SGQ strategy and CT core competencies fosters higher-order cognitive thinking in students in problem-solving through gamification of the learning environment, resulting in higher motivation and confidence to complete experimental activities.

AB  - To effectively utilize artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies such as ChatGPT and realize their novel ethical issues, individuals must have a variety of knowledge and skills about AI. Such knowledge and skills have led to the emergence of AI literacy. Despite the importance of AI literacy in everyday life, little is known about its determinants. To better understand the determinants of AI literacy, we attempted to build a research model relying on previous research and different theoretical frameworks. The model incorporated digital divide, cognitive absorption, and computational thinking. As a major finding from the current study, computational thinking was found to be a significant determinant of AI literacy, which facilitate using, recognizing, and evaluating AI-based technologies. Moreover, we found out that individuals with physical access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) are more expected to use and recognize AI. Also, motivation and skills in using ICTs enable individuals to better evaluate the outcomes of AI-based technologies. The findings also showed that convenient access to ICTs contributes to a deep involvement with AI-based technologies in the use. Further, individuals with higher motivation and skills to use AI technologies are likely to have a pleasant experience after using these technologies.

AB  - Both computational thinking (CT) and creativity have been recognized as key skills for today's learners. Over the last decade, research of both skills in a single context has emerged. In this paper, we present a scoping review of 62 such empirical from 2011 to 2020. Our goal was to have a thorough understanding of the educational settings in which research on both CT and creativity was conducted, the theoretical foundations it has laid down, and the research tools used. Our findings indicate a geographical bias (dominance of the US and prominence of developed European countries), as well as a focus on secondary education and on STEM-related disciplines; this could be explained by the current situation of CT spread. We also found that when studying CT and creativity jointly, it is most common to define CT in a broader perspective than merely programming of computer science. Additionally, while creativity is largely referred to as product-related, CT is barely referred to as such. Taken together, our findings point out some gaps in the current research of CT and creativity and suggest how it should be expended on the fertile grounds of creativity, as the latter crosses geographical, age, and subject borders. Doing so may build a bridge between CT and creativity in a way that will benefit both.

AB  - This paper sheds light on 3–5-year-old children’s enactments of computational empowerment (CE) in activities with computational thinking (CT). CT is widely elaborated on as a universal problem-solving approach and a skill set necessary for thriving in today’s digitized societies. Scholars claim that CT for all should be ensured from an early age, and several studies develop and examine age-appropriate technological tools, as well as pedagogical approaches, for young children’s learning of CT. Based on 1.5 years of co-designing for children’s situated CT in two Danish kindergartens, the present study conducts a socioculturally informed analysis of video-observed interactions between children and educational robots. The findings display how children and robots engage in interactions that transcend children’s mastery of CT in any narrow sense. This is examined as situated enactments of CE; as children’s critical and informed decisions regarding the roles that technologies, in this case educational robots, can play in their institutionally situated social lives. The paper concludes that children’s various enactments of CE deserve scholarly and professional attention, both as an important prerequisite for, and as a necessary limitation to, the implementation of CT in kindergartens.

AB  - Since the end of the 20th century, the digitalization of society, including the educational systems, has been growing exponentially. At the same time, education systems have been evolving towards competency-based assessment. Likewise, at the beginning of this century, the idea of Computational Thinking was resurrected by J. Wing, for solving problems and designing systems using concepts of computer science. Today, we can see how all these questions are taking shape in a new competence, called Computational Thinking, related to others that already exist. In this paper, we have studied the skills of Computational Thinking in university students, focusing on abstraction and its possible relationship with other factors. Results conclude that the students fail in relation to abstraction and in algorithmic thinking. Although the ability of abstraction is not easy to measure, a linear regression analysis has been carried out in order to determine its possible study.

AB  - Teaching computational thinking (CT) has become a priority for educators and policymakers tasked with educating and training students for future jobs which are predicted to be increasingly automated. Recent research on effective instructional interventions for developing computational thinking skills, including algorithmic and critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity, and cooperativity, suggests that teaching and learning CT can improve student academic performance. In fact, the extant literature is quite sanguine about the topic of CT. However, few studies have attempted to establish a relationship between CT skills and academic performance. In the present cross-sectional study, we employ path analysis to model the structural relationship between self-reported CT skills and academic performance of a sample of 81 computer science undergraduates enrolled at a Southwestern American university. We found few direct relationships between CT skills and academic performance. We only find a significant positive relationship between creativity and academic performance and a significant negative relationship between cooperativity and academic performance. Our findings are surprising considering the abundant research promoting computational thinking as a key component of 21st century skills. The findings call for further in-depth analysis of computational thinking and the influence on students’ learning and learning outcomes. We discuss our results with respect to recent educational mandates for including CT and instructional alignment in school curricula. Our findings contribute to the existing discussion by helping to clarify the relationship between CT skills and academic performance in higher education.

AB  - Although studies have shown that computational thinking (CT) can enhance learning processes and outcomes across traditional subjects, they have not shown how teachers might scaffold children's CT processes in a technology-mediated learning context. This exploratory study examined how teacher talk and technologies impacted the CT of three children (6 to 8 years old). Seven videotaped 90-minute sessions of weekly project-based activities yielded 4,842 turns of talk (2,974 by children). Statistical discourse analysis revealed the following results. After a teacher command, the children more often executed a sequence of actions toward a solution but less often demonstrated problem understanding than otherwise. Following a teacher's open question, the children were more likely to offer logically organized ideas. In response to a teacher's rhetorical question, they more often searched for information. These results inform educators regarding when to use each type of teacher talk to scaffold children's CT processes.

AB  - ChatGPT (generative pre-trained transformer) is one of the artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that have started to be used in programming education. However, the effect of using ChatGPT in programming education on learning processes and outcomes is not yet known. This study investigated the effect of programming education using the ChatGPT on students' computational thinking skills, programming self-efficacy, and motivation toward the lesson. The research was conducted on 45 undergraduate students who took a university-level programming course. The research was carried out according to the experimental design with the pretest-posttest control group. Students were randomly divided into experimental (n = 21) and control (n = 24) groups. While the experimental group students benefited from the ChatGPT during the weekly programming practices, the control group students did not use this tool. Research data were obtained through the computational thinking scale, computer programming self-efficacy scale, and learning motivation in computer programming courses scale. Research findings revealed that the experimental group students' computational thinking skills, programming self-efficacy, and motivation for the lesson were significantly higher than the control group students. In line with this result, it can be said that it may be useful to benefit from AI technologies such as ChatGPT in programming trainings. The research findings, it was emphasized how the most effective use of AI support in the lessons could be made, and various suggestions were made for researchers and educators in this regard.

AB  - In this paper, we explore how the theoretical notion of possibility space offers a way to study how children's computational thinking develops as a process. Drawing on embodied notions of cognition, we first examine the literature that supports how children's computational thinking emerges as a possibility space that involves conceptualizing possible actions in a given moment, deciding which action to take by anticipating the results of a possible action, and learning from the actions that they have taken. We then use a grounded approach to analyze the problem-solving process of two 5th-grade children who engaged in an educational robotics activity over two 50-minute class periods. The findings lend support for approaching children's computational thinking as a cycle of action-taking that includes conceptualizing, anticipating, and taking action. The findings also support the pedagogical practice of having children predict the results of a computer program to enhance their computational thinking. Implications for the way that teachers can support children in learning to conceptualize what is possible and take action from it are discussed.

AB  - Predictive learner modelling is crucial for personalized education. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great success in education, their potential in learner modelling via image data is unexplored. This research introduces a novel and interpretable approach for Image-based Learner Modelling (ImageLM) using CNNs and transfer learning to model learners’ performance and accordingly classify their computational thinking solutions. The approach integrates Grad-CAM, enabling it to provide insights into its decision-making process. Findings show that our custom CNN outperforms other models (namely ResNet, VGG, and Inception), with 83% accuracy in predicting solution correctness. More importantly, the ImageLM approach identifies the regions that contribute the most to the predictions, shedding light on learners' computational thinking knowledge and advancing toward trustworthy AI for education. These results underline the potential of utilizing imagery data from learners’ activities during the learning process to predict their performance, especially in challenging environments like programming where traditional feature extraction and learning might struggle.

AB  - The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has led to the proliferation of computational thinking (CT) education. However, research on unplugged activities’ influence in elementary math classrooms is limited, despite some exploring programming's cognitive benefits. This study presents both qualitative and quantitative analyzes stemming from a ten-week quasi-experimental research endeavor, specifically tailored for third-grade students. The research devised a series of unplugged activities, encompassing mathematical games, hands-on construction of mathematical logic boards, and calculating shopping discounts. The overarching objective was to investigate the impact of these unplugged activities on students’ mathematical creativity and CT. Students participating in a mathematics curriculum based on unplugged activities (N = 47) were compared with students participating in a traditional lecture-based mathematics curriculum (N = 46). The results indicated that unplugged activities exhibited significant advantages in fostering students’ CT and mathematical creativity across three dimensions, namely, problem-posing creativity (t = 5.830, p < 0.01), problem-solving creativity (t = 6.633, p < 0.01), and creative self-efficacy (t = 7.554, p < 0.01). Furthermore, the study revealed a relationship between students’ mathematical creativity as a predictor of CT. The results of the quantitative analysis were supported by the teacher's and students’ interview data, and the students felt excited and interested in the unplugged activities, whereas some students using the lecture-based method reported boredom and lack of interactivity. This research offered valuable insights for mathematics and CT education practice, underscoring unplugged activity as an innovative instructional approach that brings forth new possibilities for traditional mathematics teaching, with potential applications in the K-12 curriculum.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has received worldwide attention due to its alignment with developing 21st century skills such as creativity, problem-solving, and digital competence. With the increasing provision of programming tools such as robotic toys and tablet apps in the sector of early childhood education (ECE), many ECE researchers and practitioners tend to link CT to programming. However, children are reluctant to sustain their interests in programming activities, and may be further demotivated by debugging failures. This multi-group quasi-experimental study aimed to evaluate the effects of a story-inspired approach in bridging the gap between programming and CT for preschool children. Building on previous literature suggesting storytelling as a powerful, culturally responsive pedagogy, 5-year-old children (N=108) were involved in nine weeks of CT learning via one of the three conditions: Story-Inspired Robot Programming (SIRP), Story-Inspired Tablet Programming (SITP), and unplugged CT education. Results revealed that children who participated in the SIRP and SITP conditions showed improved CT scores, relative to unplugged CT education, even after controlling for baseline CT scores. No gender or family socioeconomic effects were found to influence the benefits of story-inspired programming interventions. These findings suggest that storytelling as a culturally responsive approach, whether using robots or tablets as a programming tool, can provide young children with more inclusive and sustainable CT learning experiences.

AB  - Content area K-12 teachers are increasingly asked to integrate computing and computational thinking into their classrooms, yet they often have little experience with computing. The purpose of this study was to understand how science teachers, new to computing and integrating computational thinking into their classrooms, supported students as computational problem solvers. In the project from which this research was drawn, 8th grade science teachers in three US school districts integrated computer game design into their study of climate systems and climate change. We conducted participant observation, collected teacher implementation logs and interviewed 15 teachers engaged in the three-year design research project, Building Systems from Scratch. Analysis through grounded theory yielded several results related to teachers’ orientations, strategies, and use of resources to create systems of distributed expertise. We identified five major themes: a) releasing responsibility to students, b) co-learning with students, c) encouraging students’ independent problem solving, d) building interdependence among students, and e) providing multiple other resources. Findings are discussed in relation to the literature on integrating computational thinking into content area classrooms.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is currently used as an umbrella term in education to describe the processes associated with learning and applying computer science concepts and strategies for problem-solving. Despite a growing body of literature on the subject within education and the development of a grand variety of tools designed to enhance computational thinking abilities, the relations between CT and other cognitive abilities have not been reported in young children. Understanding CT from a cognitive development perspective could be useful for creating targeted interventions tailored for young children. In the present study, we compare a previously reported computational thinking assessment with a battery of nine cognitive tests, which include fluid intelligence, working memory, planning, sequencing, mental rotation, vocabulary, and early math precursors such as numerical transcoding and symbolic magnitude comparison. Mixed-effects linear regressions were implemented with CT as a dependent variable to explore the associations between our variables. A subsample of children who participated in an educational robotics intervention were assessed in their robot programming performance, and its outcomes were compared with their CT assessments. Results suggest temporal sequencing ability and symbolic magnitude comparison are significant predictors of CT in kindergarten. Positive significant associations between robot programming and CT performance are reported.

AB  - The research aims to evaluate the effect of a robotics-based computational thinking program on executive functions and visuospatial skills in preschool children. Additionally, the study will explore the relationship between these three variables and early experiences with toys. The study will be a cluster-randomized controlled trial with pre- and post-intervention measures. Participants will be preschool children aged 5 to 6 years from both public and private institutions. The intervention will involve a new educational robotics device called ROVERSA and will consist of eight sessions distributed over four weeks, with the experimental group placed on a waitlist. To assess executive functions and visuospatial skills, standardized and validated neuropsychological measures will be used, including the Flanker task, the NIH Toolbox Card Sorting Test, the Corsi Block Test, the NEPSY-II Mental Rotation Test, the Pyramid of Mexico from the ENI-2 battery, and the Computational Thinking Test (CTt). Data analysis will begin with a hypothesis tested through ANOVA-MR, and linear regressions will be implemented to assess the relationship between variables. It is expected that the results will contribute to the discussion on teaching computational thinking and educational robotics as early learning experiences and their impact on the cognitive development of children.

The program aimed to enhance pedagogical knowledge and competencies. Findings indicated significant positive improvements in teachers' STEM self-efficacy, computational thinking, and entrepreneurship skills. The PD program also had a direct positive influence on the quality of lesson plans. The study suggests that effective PD design should incorporate scientific inquiry, engineering design processes, computational thinking, entrepreneurship skills, and the development of teachers' self-efficacy for successful implementation of PD outcomes in STEM education.

AB  - Educators emphasize that computational thinking is especially helpful in raising problem-solving skills, improving logical reasoning, and developing analytical thinking. In this context, the aim of this study is to develop an online, interactive, valid, reliable and useful performance-based assessment tool for measuring computational thinking skills. Data were collected in two stages with three different measurement tools. In the data collection phase, a psychometric scale, a skill test and an interactive web application developed in this study were used. In the study in which a total of 203 high school students participated, it was determined that the students' computational thinking skills were at average level. as a result, a valid and reliable performance-based platform was developed for measuring computational thinking skills. It has also been concluded that the performance-based measurement tool makes a better measurement than the psychometric scale. It is emphasized that computational thinking should be treated as a skill or group of skills, not as a theoretical knowledge, product/portfolio or attitude/perception. Therefore, it is believed that developing performance-based tools for evaluating computational thinking skills and measuring them by using multiple measurement tools will give more accurate results. Considering the developments in computational thinking, it is thought that the study will contribute to the literature.

AB  - Computing education has progressively entered into children's early years. Due to a proliferation of computing education programs and coding tools designed for young children, research on the relationships between computational thinking (CT) and other domains of learning and development is highly warranted. Yet, there is little empirical evidence that shows the relationship between CT and children's overall cognitive functioning. As such, this study explored the relationships between Chinese children's CT and their sequencing ability and self-regulation in early childhood. One hundred and one Chinese young children (Ngirl = 52 and Nboy = 49; Mage = 5.25, SD = 0.73) were recruited and evaluated with three reliable instruments. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that: (1) CT positively predicted sequencing ability (β = 0.27, p < .05) even after controlling for relevant demographic covariates such as age, gender, and family socioeconomic status; (2) CT positively predicted self-regulation (β = 0.47, p < .001) after controlling for demographic covariates. Our findings suggest that CT may be a domain-general ability that is based on cognitive foundations that extend beyond the realm of computing.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is regarded as the conceptual basis required for identifying and solving real-world problems through algorithmic approaches to achieve transferable solutions. Developing students' CT in primary school stages is essential and has received considerable attention. Meanwhile, researchers incorporated digital badges into classrooms to improve students' learning motivation in computer science (CS). However, few solid empirical studies analyze the effects of the digital badges approach in CS education to develop students' CT. Therefore, to bridge this gap, this study designed and implemented a block-based programming course in a primary school and examined the impact of the digital badges approach on pupils' CT skills and self-efficacy and learning motivation in CS. A quasi-experimental design was conducted among 99 third-grade students across three classes. The results revealed that the adapted digital badges in primary school (1) significantly improved the students' CT skills, (2) had no significant positive impact on their CT self-efficacy or learning motivation in CS, and (3) showed no mediating effect of learning motivation on the relationship between CT skills and CT self-efficacy. In addition, we found that whether students could see only their own digital badges or also those of others had no impact on CT skills, self-efficacy, or learning motivation in CS. These findings have implications for the design of digital badge educational interventions intended to promote students' CT and learning motivation.

AB  - Computational thinking refers to a series of cognitive processes involved in solving problems through computational systems. A growing body of studies has managed to demonstrate the correlation between computational thinking and different cognitive domains. In recent decades, multiple studies have taken place that seek to evaluate the effect of computational thinking on higher-order cognitive processes. The current study aims to contribute to this discussion by analyzing the effect of an intervention program in computational thinking on the executive functions of school-age children. In this experimental study, 30 children aged 10 and 11 were randomly assigned to an experimental group and an active control group. The instruments to collect the data were 15 tests of the neuropsychological battery of executive functions and frontal lobes BANFE-2, which were applied to both groups before and after the intervention. The experimental group participated in an 8-week computational thinking intervention during which its participants enrolled in plugged and unplugged activities and carried out block programming language twice a week. The results showed that the intervention had significant effects on executive functions associated with the anterior prefrontal cortex and the dorsolateral cortex, but not those related to the orbitofrontal area.

AB  - Learning coding during early childhood is an effective way for children to practice computational thinking. Aspects of children's motivation can increase the likelihood that children approach computational thinking activities with enthusiasm and deep engagement. Gender inequities may interfere with children's readiness to take advantage of opportunities to build computational thinking skills through activities such as coding. Societal stereotypes can reduce young girls’ motivation to engage with computer science, preventing them from gaining benefits from coding activities designed to support computational thinking. This study examined children's gender stereotypes as well as children's own motivation for computer coding in 363 first- through third-grade children. We assessed gender differences in both stereotypes and motivation, as well as links between the stereotypes that individual children held and their own motivation. Children generally endorsed stereotypes about interest and ability for computer coding that favored their own-gender group, although third-grade girls reported gender-egalitarian beliefs about interest in coding. There were no gender differences in children's motivation for computer coding in terms of their own interest, sense of belonging, or ability self-concepts. Children's stereotypes about their own-gender group were significantly positively correlated with their own motivation for computer coding. These findings suggest that early childhood represents an excellent age for children to begin building computational thinking skills, before girls endorse negative stereotypes about their gender's interest in computer science.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is an essential skill students need if they are to adapt to the rise of digital society, and the evaluation of CT is crucial for enhancing students’ CT. However, the current evaluation of CT is based on a summative paradigm and ignores real CT performance during the assessment process. This study thus used a multimodal cognitive diagnostic model (H-MCDM) of students’ CT based on multimodal data in situational tasks, to achieve precise evaluation and explore the current mastery status of students’ CT and their cognitive and behavioral characteristics. The research results indicate that: 1) students’ CT was at a moderately high level and indicated a good grasp of the CT components of problem decomposition and algorithm design, but students had not yet mastered problem abstraction, 2) a total of six different CT latent patterns were discerned in the overall student results, 3) individual students who shared the same CT latent patterns could differ in their cognitive and behavioral characteristics, while those with different CT latent patterns could share similar characteristics. This study showed that it is possible to capture the degree of students’ mastery of CT and their cognitive and behavioral differences with the same or different CT latent patterns at a granular level, providing a basis for developing individualized strategies to enhance students’ CT.

AB  - In-service elementary school teachers need training to teach computational thinking (CT). A common model for CT professional learning programs includes an initial workshop followed by ongoing support. However, little research has examined the efficacy of ongoing support, the most effective types, and its impact on classroom practices. The current study details a multifaceted CT professional learning program with innovative ongoing support to help elementary school teachers implement the Code.org curriculum. It also empirically investigated the impact of the support on teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT, the effectiveness of each component of the support, and to what extent it affected teachers' classroom practices. Our ongoing support included an additional workshop, grade-level professional learning community (PLC) sessions, instructional videos, and teacher leaders' support. Data included a pre-survey, four post-surveys, lesson observations, a focus group interview, tracking the number of video views, and surveys from PLC participants and teacher leaders. Results indicated that the ongoing support significantly increased teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT. Regarding the effectiveness of the various components of the ongoing support, the additional workshop significantly increased teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT. Teachers valued each component of the support, and this support improved teachers’ classroom practices.

AB  - The present study investigates the debugging process of 526 children in preschool (4–6 aged) when programming a tangible robot. When a child is involved in programming, it is needed to identify and correct errors, or in other words, debug a program. Debugging is a high-level thinking skill and is an essential component closely related to developing Computational Thinking in early childhood education. Though the debugging process is a cognitive function in programming investigated by many researchers in recent decades, most studies are conducted either in primary, secondary education, or higher education concerning beginners or experts in programming. Very few reviews, and some focus on preschool education. Our study set out the following objectives: 1) How do children identify the existence of error and locate it? 2) What types of errors emerge when coding? 3) What type of error is complex for novice programmers? 4) What strategies are developed by novice programmers to debug effectively? and 5) What types of knowledge do novice programmers construct by debugging the tangible robot Bee-Bot? The study follows an iterative model of a design-based research approach. It uses multiple case studies to collect qualitative and quantitative data. The programming intervention was implemented by 30 educators in their classrooms and was based on a scenario-based teaching design. The debugging process was analysed using Klahr & Craven's framework (1988): 1) test and evaluate program, 2) identify bug, 3) represent program, 4) locate bug and 5) correct bug. The main finding is the construction and development of syntactic and semantic knowledge.

AB  - A plethora of programming platforms purports to teach preschool-aged children computational thinking (CT) and coding skills. However, the empirical evidence to support their effectiveness is still in its early stages. A three-week didactic intervention using ScratchJr was conducted to investigate its effectiveness in fostering CT and rudimentary coding skills in a cohort of preschool children (N = 34, aged 4–6 years). While the initial performance mean of the control group (M = 7.07, SD = 2.58) exhibits a statistically significant elevation t (22.64 = 2.23, p = 0.036) vis-à-vis the experimental group (M = 5.35, SD = 1.58), t (22.64) = 2.23, p = 0.0 the terminal performance means of both groups converge closely. However, meticulous data analysis unveils a statistically notable enhancement among preschool participants exposed to the educational intervention involving ScratchJr. Notably, both instructional modalities appear commensurate in nurturing elementary computational tenets, namely modularity and control structures. The experimental cohort outperforms the control group with statistical significance in comprehending potent ideational constructs encompassing representation, algorithms, and hardware/software interplay. Conversely, the control group performs better in grasping the debugging concept than their experimental counterparts. The outcomes lend substantive credence to the efficacy of the distinct programming milieu offered by ScratchJr, underscoring its effectiveness in cultivating CT and coding proficiencies within the preschool demographic.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is crucial for students. Robot-supported learning has emerged as a popular approach for CT cultivation. To understand the effects of robot-supported CT cultivation, the current study conducted a meta-analysis to analyze studies from Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Science Direct databases (2012–2022) which screened using keywords ``computational thinking'' and ``robot''. After further screening, 26 peer-reviewed articles were selected. We synthesized the 33 effect sizes to assess the overall effectiveness of robot-supported learning on CT and its sub-dimensions: concepts, practices, and perspectives. Our findings revealed a medium effect of robot-supported learning on students' CT (g = 0.643), a large effect on CT concepts (g = 0.650), a medium effect on CT practices (g = 0.587), and a huge effect on CT perspectives (g = 1.419). We also explored the moderators (i.e., grade level, study duration, culture, learning strategy, and assessment tool) that might influence the effects of robot-supported CT cultivation. Moderator analyses indicated that short-term (less than four weeks) robot-supported learning had a larger effect (g = 0.901) on CT practice than long-term (more than eleven weeks) learning (g = 0.309). This meta-analysis indicates that educators could apply robot-supported learning to cultivate students' CT and concludes with related implications.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has gained increasing recognition as a 21st-century competency. Although initiatives have been taken to define the term for educational practices, limited empirical evidence is available to clarify its underlying components, especially at the primary education level. This study aimed to identify the associations between CT and specific cognitive skills in the primary school context. Based on the literature, three cognitive domains were studied (i.e., mathematical, visuospatial, and reasoning skills) and standard test batteries were applied to a sample of 633 primary students (aged 7–12 years). Linear regression analyses were performed with CT performance as the dependent variable to investigate its associations with the measured cognitive skills, and demographic features (i.e., age, gender) and coding learning experience (i.e., years of coding experience, extra-curricular coding experience) were included as control variables. The results indicated that the students’ CT performance was significantly predicted by their attainments in numeracy, visual perception, spatial visualisation, and inductive reasoning, and the results remained significant after controlling for demographics and coding experience. The study adds to the literature by enriching the understanding of CT as a psychological construct and has practical implications for educational stakeholders regarding the importance of interdisciplinary teaching and the integration of specific cognitive skills into CT learning activities.

AB  - The sustainable and digital future of work may imply a dramatic equilibrium change between social factors and technological ones. We argue that providing suitable tools to support End-User Development (EUD) in the workplace could represent a way to cope with such future changes. The contributions of this paper include the analysis and characterization of the most used EUD techniques and their crossover with a new conveyed model of Computational Thinking. The synthesis between these aspects is made explicit in the construct of EUDability, which is designed to capture the quality dimensions of EUD systems suitable to work scenarios where better roles and better tools for individuals may be shaped. EUDability has to do with identifying and assessing the difficulties of EUD techniques on one side and the Computational Thinking skills held by individuals on the other side.

AB  - There has been an increasing interest in the integration of technology into language education. Meanwhile, computational thinking (CT) skills are fostered which influence communicative language teaching and learning. Despite CT's established importance in science education, its significance in language teaching remains scarce. This study contributes to knowledge synthesis and methodological development by reviewing 16 journal articles, analyzing CT applications in language learning across educational contexts, intervention tools, CT skills, language acquisition, and assessment methods. The results indicate that (a) more CT-involved activities are needed for primary, secondary, and tertiary education, (b) educational robots and Scratch stand out as the most trending intervention tools, (c) CT skills such as decomposition, abstraction, generalization and so on have a positive effect on students’ foreign language acquisition, especially in grammar and writing, (d) assessment of CT development can be surveyed through a validated and reliable instrument such as computer programming self-efficacy scale or an online platform: Dr. Scratch; Conversely, there is a diversity of evaluation tools in foreign language learning. This study is the first to review experimental research on integrating computational thinking into foreign language learning and offers significant implications for future research.

AB  - The development of programming skills and computational thinking in the formal educational context is one of the most recent horizons set by many educational systems worldwide. Although the first computational thinking initiatives are being applied from the earliest school ages, this research focuses on the secondary education level. Specifically, the objective is the following: to analyse the implementation of Arduino, as well as the benefits and opportunities it brings to secondary school students. For this purpose, documentary research has been undertaken applying a systematic review according to the PRISMA 2020 framework following the PiCoS strategy. Atlas.ti 9 was used to analyse the information. Out of 316 papers identified, 37 were included in the research. In relation to the results, Arduino is primarily used in technology and physics subjects, although it is also used to develop interdisciplinary STEAM projects. As a rule, it is used to learn programming languages, but likewise as a resource to develop science experiments. LED lights, servomotors and breadboards are among the most commonly used resources together with the Arduino board. and Scratch was the most widely used software. The initiatives implemented have yielded both positive and negative results, for example, one drawback is that some projects are very difficult, and some achievements such as: increased motivation towards the contents addressed or also the development of some soft skills, such as problem solving.

AB  - Recently, virtual reality (VR) technology has shown great potential in advancing education with many pedagogical benefits for building the 21st-century teaching and learning experience. This study conducted a formative evaluation of an immersive VR expedition application with the aim of understanding users' learning processes and how the application facilitates higher education students' computational thinking skills. Six participants were randomly selected to conduct this evaluation. A mixed research approach consisting of quantitative and qualitative methods was employed. The study quantitatively analyzed users' scores from gameplay to understand how the intervention supported computational thinking skills. Participants were also interviewed to collect data after playing the mini-games to investigate users' experiences. The study showcases players' computational thinking competency, assessed automatically during gameplay. Further, this study used inductive content analysis to demonstrate users' reactions to prototyped VR mini-games. The qualitative findings suggest that users found the VR mini-games interactive and immersive, which provided an opportunity to foster learners' computational thinking skills. The quantitative analysis revealed that student's computational thinking competency can be enhanced through consistent playing of the mini-games. Moreover, the expedition aspect of the VR game stimulated learners' curiosity, which sustained their learning progress. Furthermore, users gained new knowledge and found the mini-games educative. Nevertheless, several aspects of the VR mini-games need improvements, according to users' perceptions. This study contributes to the knowledge in terms of the affordances of VR in education research and provides relevant insights that can shape future studies, for example, the recent hype of metaverse in education.

AB  - Project-Based Learning (PBL) and Computational Thinking (CT), a teaching strategy and a problem-solving method, respectively, have been widely used in teaching and learning because of their educational advantages for students and teachers. However, studies of their integration into the teaching and learning process have been scarce, resulting in a lack of guidance for educators to implement such an approach that apply constructivism learning theory. This study aims to systematically review and identify appropriate frameworks, models, techniques and tools that could guide the successful implementation of PBL-CT. This study examined relevant articles published from 2017 to 2021 to highlight the gaps in the PBL-CT execution and map their backgrounds into a coherent taxonomy that could help guide the directions of future studies. As revealed, none of such articles explicitly explain any suitable PBL-CT frameworks or models. The study identified several common elements for the PBL-CT framework formulation, indicating scaffolding and inquiry are the most commonly applied techniques, with visual tools dominating the PBL-CT implementation. Most articles involved computing, followed by STEM, with a few originating from non-STEM fields. Several important implications could help educators develop an effective PBL-CT course design and provide some guidelines for future research. An effective PBL-CT integration enhances teaching and learning besides improving students' computational thinking skills. Thinking skills are critical 21st-century skills needed for students' success.

AB  - Computational thinking has become an integral component of curricula worldwide, necessitating teachers to develop this competence in their students. To effectively meet these curricular requirements, teachers themselves need a solid foundation of computational thinking content knowledge, which refers to the understanding and skills they possess in this area. However, despite widespread recognition of this need, few studies have rigorously examined teachers' content knowledge in this domain. Addressing this gap requires the development of high-quality measurement tools. This study details the development of an instrument, created as part of the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) 2023 in Flanders, to measure lower secondary school teachers' computational thinking content knowledge in a valid and reliable way. The article first outlines the construction process of the instrument, which involved close collaboration with experts in the field and drew upon the framework of Fraillon et al. (2023). Following this, the instrument's psychometric properties are presented, which include both item-level and overall instrument characteristics. These properties were evaluated using data from a sample of 352 participants, applying both Classical Test Theory and Item Response Theory. The final tool consists of sixteen multiple-choice and short constructed response questions. The results indicate favorable item and overall instrument characteristics, thereby affirming its potential to measure the intended construct in a valid and accurate way.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) skills help students both understand and utilize computing in various domains to cope with the challenges posed by the complex digital world. This study applied mind mapping to programming language instruction in a primary school, and explored the effects of mind mapping on students' CT skills when learning programming with Scratch as a programming tool. Two types of mind mapping, construct-by-self mind mapping (CBS-MM) and construct-on-scaffold mind mapping (COS-MM), were proposed to compare which type is more effective in terms of students' CT skills. Seventy-three public primary school fifth-grade students aged 10 to 11 participated in the study. The CBS group included 33 students learning with the CBS-MM instructional approach, while the COS group comprised 40 students learning with the COS-MM instructional approach. Data were obtained from nine topic Scratch programming assignments and pre- and post-CT skills surveys completed by the two groups. Paired sample t tests were used to analyze whether the two types of mind mapping approach could improve both groups' CT skills. One-way ANCOVA and one-way ANOVA were used to examine the difference in the two groups' CT skills. The results showed that both CBS-MM and COS-MM can improve students' CT skills; however, the COS group students could better improve their CT skills with the assistance of the COS-MM method compared with the CBS group students who learned with the CBS-MM method. The findings of this study can provide some enlightenment for relevant instructors to design instruction and implement programming teaching with different kinds of mind mapping support that facilitates students’ CT.

AB  - The specific mechanisms by which teachers and parents can provide culturally relevant opportunities for computational thinking for racially/ethnically and linguistically diverse groups of preschoolers remain unknown. Accordingly, the purpose of this research is to examine how PreK parent and teacher voice directed efforts to realize a culturally relevant computing program. We drew data sources from a subsample of design-based research meetings in which partners collaborated to co-develop the first iteration of the program. Using qualitative analysis, we examined how parent voice and teacher voice, conceptualized as perspectives and participation, influenced theories of culturally responsive computing and computational thinking in early childhood education and the translation of theory into practice in classroom and home settings. Findings showed that connecting powerful ideas from computational thinking, namely algorithms and problem solving (e.g., debugging), to familiar activities and experiences served as a powerful entry point. Yet, differences arose in how teachers and parents conceptualized culturally relevant computing and made connections to familiar routines. We discuss what can be learned from parent voice in regards to bolstering children's self-expression, access to increasingly complex computational thinking tasks, and opportunities for learning cultural and community values through computing.

AB  - In recent years, the development of computational thinking (CT) has become integral to many school curricula worldwide. This has been associated with calls for computational thinking to be considered a ‘21St Century’ competency, valuable to all students as a transferable process for solving problems and building understanding of human behaviour and systems. However, while computational thinking is a focus of most secondary school computer science curricula, proponents such as Jeanette Wing argue its relevance for younger students, indicating more work must be done investigating its development in early years' education. This study used a structured, problem-based curriculum supported by guided inquiry pedagogy, to explore 6 year old students' learning of basic computational thinking concepts and practices while coding programmable floor robots (Blue-bots and an iPad app). Results indicated improvement across the seven lessons in students' sequencing/algorithm authoring, error correction, and pattern recognition. Furthermore, they revealed evidence of higher order thinking such as identifying patterns in code, and how these can be transferred to help solve problems of different designs. While currently play-based approaches are used to introduce computational thinking concepts and practices in early years' education, results from this study suggest that more structured, problem-based methods should be seriously considered. Results challenge commonly understood developmental theories about what young children can and can't do, contextualised within the field of computer science, and hold implications for early years' teachers' professional knowledge and pedagogy if they are to promote their students' learning in this increasingly important area. Given rapid technological advancements such as artificial intelligence (AI) and increasingly earlier exposure of young children to digitally-mediated information, this study provides support for the earlier and more systematic introduction of basic digital literacy knowledge and skills in early years' education.

In this study, we investigated the robots used, proposed activities, and evaluation processes. We also analyzed research contexts and the stated motivations to conduct the studies. Our review identified characteristics of the robots, such as input and output interfaces, cost, and availability. We also categorized activities considering context, modality of work, type of activities, duration, adults’ role, scaffolding, unplugged activities, explicit debugging, communication and sharing instances, and teaching knowledge from other domains. We analyzed the computational thinking evaluation process looking at types of assessments, asset concepts, and research design. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of existing research, identifies existing gaps, and provides recommendations for future studies.

AB  - The integration of computational thinking (CT) into K-12 education offers substantial potential to improve digital literacy and deepen students’ understanding across various subject areas. By embedding computational procedures and solution-oriented approaches into traditional curricula, students can develop essential skills that are critical for thriving in an increasingly digital world. However, the effective integration of CT into subject-specific learning poses challenges for educators, largely due to a lack of training and experience in implementing interdisciplinary instructional strategies. This study explores the impact of integrating CT into K-12 education through diverse instructional approaches, including modelling, storytelling, and unplugged activities. The research examines how students' subject knowledge, CT concepts, and practices evolved under each CT integration practice, as well as their acceptance toward CT integrated lessons. The study was conducted in different subjects, including language arts, biology, and physics, and at different grade levels. The technology acceptance model was used as a theoretical framework to understand students' adoption towards the different integration practices. The study revealed that different CT integration practices yield varying impacts on students' attitudes, particularly in relation to their prior programming experiences. Namely, primary school students with prior programming experience display a higher behavioural intention due to a lack of early biases toward programming. Conversely, secondary school students, less familiar with interdisciplinary approaches, initially show less enthusiasm for future engagement. These insights underscore the need for tailored instructional strategies that consider students' prior experiences and the broader goal of preparing them to contribute to a technologically driven society.

AB  - As we begin to identify essential skills for the future, there has been an increased focus on how to define and implement computational thinking within education. However, the question of how to engage children with coding activities within the context and limitations of the curriculum remains relatively explored. In our study, a human-centered design approach was followed to guide a small group of children through the co-design, implementation and evaluation of a board game. The board game had two versions: an offline version involving a robotic agent and an online version with its digital equivalent. A mixed-method approach was used to understand and compare levels of engagement, usability, and collaboration in both versions of the game. The tangible aspect of working with a robotic agent in the offline version led to greater levels of motivation and involvement with the game mechanics. Tangible robotics games tend to be more approachable for children. Our study shows that using such games by connecting the mathematics curriculum with coding problems can successfully engage participants in collaborative computational thinking activities. We contribute to the field by providing human-centered guidance for the creation of educational tools to develop computational thinking. Such guidance is not only applicable in technologically rich environments; it can also be applied in educational communities with limited access to technology.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has been relevant in teaching STEM courses, and educators are incorporating both plugged and unplugged CT activities in their modules to prepare new entrants for advanced knowledge. However, additional empirical data are needed to understand how an unplugged activities approach can lead to an improved understanding of CT concepts. Therefore, this study investigates the impact of unplugged activities on novice students' CT skills and unravels the characteristics of students' CT competency from performing unplugged activities. The experimental aspect of this study was conducted with a cohort of 210 students participating in an introductory programming course at a University in Nigeria. A mixed-method research approach and a quasi-experimental design were applied in this study to understand how the unplugged approach in teaching CT could help students improve their CT competency. A paired-sample t-test of familiarity score for each CT concept showed a significant increase in the score before and after the intervention. Furthermore, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was used for topic modeling of the text describing students’ solutions. Topic modeling allows for more insights into the steps taken by the students to solve CT problems. Only 27.62 % of students' solution descriptions contained CT concepts, 56.90 % of the students solved the puzzle with an optimal score, and 72.41 % of students who applied CT concepts of problem abstraction and decomposition were able to solve the puzzle correctly. Indeed, CT unplugged activities significantly increased the number of students who gained CT competency. In addition, this study provides recommendation for computer science educators and highlight future direction.

AB  - Computational thinking is a fundamental competence that is being introduced in K-12 and succeeding curricula worldwide. Despite this huge effort, many computational thinking models in the literature do not explicitly take into consideration the pupils’ age and the developmental nature of computational thinking skills. Furthermore, many existing computational thinking models are focused on the internal thinking processes of the individuals, failing to explicitly consider the situated nature, in terms of social context and artefactual environment, that usually characterise tasks that require computational thinking to be solved. In this paper, we present a framework for the design, realisation, analysis, and assessment of computational thinking activities, called CT-cube. The CT-cube allows to extend existing computational thinking models to consider the life-long development of computational thinking skills in individuals, from childhood to adult age, and to take into consideration the situated nature of computational thinking activities. We use the CT-cube to design an unplugged task, called Cross Array Task (CAT), allowing to assess the algorithmic skills of K-12 pupils and we show how the CT-cube can be used in this case to illustrate the development of this competence along the entire compulsory school path, considering a sample of 109 pupil aged 3 to 16 in Switzerland.

AB  - The current single teaching and assessing modes of English as a foreign language (EFL) grammar in China have caused the disconnect between grammar knowledge and competency with numerous errors in essay writing, somehow ignoring the analysis of learners thinking patterns. To solve the problem, computational thinking (CT), a higher-order thinking in solving problems and optimizing the way to acquire knowledge, was employed in the study. As needed, the experimental group was taught using the CT teaching model following CT principal elements (data analysis, pattern recognition, abstraction, decomposition, and parallelization), while the control group followed the traditional teaching mode. Quantitative and qualitative data were obtained based on the pre-test-post-test, classroom observation, and questionnaire survey. The results show that the grammar application in short essay writing of all the members of the experimental group significantly improved and that higher grammar learning agency and engagement were unfolded to show the changes of thinking patterns. However, not all the members from the control group showed similar results. CT serves as an important social mediation tool in EFL teaching. This study further enriches the teaching modes of grammar and is an effective attempt at introducing CT into learners’ thinking patterns.

AB  - With growing interest in supporting the development of computational thinking (CT) in early childhood, there is also need for new assessments that serve multiple purposes and uses. In particular, there is a need to understand the design of formative assessments that can be used during classroom instruction to provide feedback to teachers and children in real-time. In this paper, we report on an empirical study and advance a new unit of observational analysis for formative assessment that we call an indicator of a knowledge refinement opportunity or as a shorthand, KRO indicators. We put forth a new framework for conceptualizing the design of formative assessments that builds on the Evidence Centered Design framework but centers identification and analysis of indicators of knowledge refinement opportunities. We illustrate a number of key indicators through empirical examples drawn from video recordings of Kindergarten classroom lessons.

AB  - Interest in coding education has exploded in the past five years, especially in elementary and early secondary education. Teachers who are largely new to coding are expected to guide entire student bodies through the fundamentals of coding and computational thinking. But little is known about which coding and computational thinking (CT) concepts teachers feel most comfortable with and which concepts they struggle with. This study describes 127 elementary coding teachers’ changes in their beliefs about teaching coding and CT as they participated in year-long continuous professional development. Novice elementary coding teachers demonstrated most growth in their self-efficacy for teaching sequences, algorithms and loops. They were less secure in their knowledge of conditionals, variables, and functions. For computational thinking, teachers were most confident in their ability to identify patterns, think algorithmically, understand logic, and evaluate outcomes, showing less growth with decomposition and abstraction.

AB  - This study compares the effects of coding education with educational robot and unplugged coding activities on pre-school students' computational thinking and executive function skills. This study used a pre-test and post-test comparison group quasi-experimental design. The study was conducted in a public kindergarten with 48 pre-school students (24 educational robot- BeeBot® group and 24-unplugged coding group) aged 5-6. The TechCheck-K test was used to measure computational thinking skills, and Executive Functions Battery-Computerized Touch was used to measure executive function skills. The process started with pre-test applications and ended with post-tests after four weeks (16 different sessions) of the implementation in both groups. The study found a statistically significant difference between the computational thinking pre-test and post-test scores of pre-school students in both groups in favor of the post-test. It was determined that there was a statistically significant difference in favor of the educational robot group between the post-test scores of computational thinking skills. In addition, when the findings regarding executive functions were evaluated, there was a statistically significant difference between the pre-test and post-test scores of total executive function in favor of the post-test in both groups. However, it was observed that there was no statistically significant difference between the post-test scores of both groups in terms of total executive function skills scores. In addition, when the post-test scores of pre-school students in two groups were evaluated, it was determined that there was no significant difference in computational thinking and executive function skills according to gender. Consequently, it was determined that coding education with an educational robot was more effective for gaining computational thinking skills than unplugged coding activities for pre-school students. However, it was observed that there was no difference between the two groups in terms of the development of executive function skills in pre-school education.

AB  - Since environmental and energy issues and challenges continues to emerge as key global concerns, Green Building Certification Systems are becoming increasingly relevant in the construction industry. In this regard, LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is considered one of the most widely recognized environmental assessment methods used globally in the construction industry today. However, due to the high level of complexity of the LEED system, the tools usually used to verify the achievement of the credits lack of “design friendliness” and hardly communicate effectively with the conventional tools used by architects and engineers (e.g. CAD, BIM). This makes difficult to fully take into account, especially at the early design stage, the many interconnected aspects that contribute to the green certification, with consequent issues often arising in the design validation and/or construction phases, resulting in time delays and cost increments. The application of innovative problem-solving methods, such as computational thinking, together with coding techniques, represents an effective way to deal with this issue. This kind of methodology, in fact, allows the requirements of a specific LEED credit to be digitally parametrised and flexibly incorporated into a “designer friendly” working environment. In particular, Visual Programming Languages (VPLs), due to their high simplicity of usage, allow architects and engineers to develop algorithms and thus implement their technical knowledge in the field of environmental design with computer programming skills, useful to improve their tools and keep them constantly updated. The aim of this paper is to illustrate a methodology through which, by merging computational thinking strategies with VPL tools, is possible to keep under control, in the same working environment, all the parameters required to verify in real time the achievement of LEED credits. To demonstrate the flexibility of the approach, dedicated tools developed for the verification of some specific credits at different scales – neighbourhood and building – are illustrated as operational examples of the proposed methodology.

AB  - Computational thinking, defined by Wing (2011) as the “thought processes involved in formulating problems … so that the solutions are represented in a form that can effectively be carried out by an information-processing agent,” has become the central construct of K12 computing education around the world. This article provides a history of computational thinking, a summary of computational thinking's role in educational policy and practice, role as a research construct, and concludes by considering the future of computational thinking. The debate over how to define and teach computational thinking can be understood as a proxy for the broader questions about education.

AB  - Collecting and organizing data to understand and answer real-world questions is an increasingly important skill in our current world. Fostering data collection and analysis (DCA) skills in young children leverages key mathematics skills as well as the data representation, visualization, and interpretation skills of computational thinking (CT), culminating in a problem-solving approach with data. As such, the intervention, comprising investigations and a digital app, supported preschool teachers and children to answer data-focused questions by engaging in each step of the DCA process in order to foster CT and math skills. Teachers appreciated that the app offers a new way for children to visualize data and noted that the app provided learning opportunities for children that would not otherwise be possible or easy to implement. Results also suggest that the app provides a systematic process for data collection, entry, and interpretation. Children in classrooms that completed the intervention had significantly higher scores at post-intervention compared to children in classrooms that did not complete the intervention, controlling for pre-intervention scores, B(SE) = 0.13(0.05), t (6) = 2.48, p = .048.

AB  - Computational Thinking (CT), the conceptual foundations required for solving complex problems effectively and efficiently, is an imperative skill for today's learners, across disciplines and across ages. As for its importance in the wide network of digital literacies, CT has been implemented in various educational contexts, however mostly via digital artifacts, specifically in programming-related activities. This approach does not fulfill the potential of such integration for promoting learning. In this paper, we argue that digital literacies should not be bound to the digital realm, and present a novel approach to fully integrate CT into learning and teaching by the development of CT-infused “unplugged” pedagogical tools that are fully embedded in the subject matter. We demonstrate the advantages to student learning of these tools in two case studies from K-12 mathematics education: 1) An assistive tool for function investigation in high-school calculus – in this case, we point out to how CT skills that were implemented in the tool promoted students' problem solving; 2) A teaching unit for pattern sequences in elementary school – in this case, we show how students in the CT research group outperformed students in the other groups, and how they implemented CT to solve pattern sequence problems effectively and efficiently. We highlight that besides enhancing learning, this approach can help address the important issue of equity in education, and suggest ways to promote it via dedicated professional development.

AB  - Creativity and Computational Thinking (CT) have been pointed out as two important skills that would promote students in the digital age as contributing members of society. Therefore, these two constructs have been extensively researched in recent years, but the associations between them are yet to be fully understood. This study takes another step towards bridging this gap by examining the association between CT and three types of creativity, i.e., Figural Creative Thinking, Verbal Creative Thinking, and Computational Creativity. Data was collected from 119 ninth-grade students (14–15 years old) from Israel. Students took two commonly used creativity tests (Torrance's Test of Creative Thinking, and the Alternative Uses Test). They also used Kodetu—an online learning environment for CT—and we used the system log files to measure their CT acquirement and their computational creativity. Findings suggest some nuanced associations between the four sets of variables. Specifically, we point out the limited associations between verbal and figural creativities, some of which are negative; also, we found that the associations between creative thinking and CT, as well as between creative thinking and computational creativity, differ by gender.

AB  - Many studies have demonstrated that Virtual Exchange (VE) for teaching languages can have a positive effect on learners' intercultural awareness or achievements. However, during this century, the teaching process has shifted from teaching with technology to solving problems with it. In this regard, pedagogical experts in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) have developed programming and robotics based on Computational Thinking skills (CTs), which have been regarded as the core of 21st-century skills. In the field of CALL, this skill has received very little attention. Accordingly, we have attempted to switch the process and outcome of language learning in VE. Thus, we developed the conceptual framework that integrated CTsCALL and Individual-technology-task-environment Fit (ITTEF). Having designed our VE tasks based on CTsCALL, we provided the opportunity for 92 Spanish language learners in our project to exchange language and culture with Cypriot and Irish students and solve VE tasks based on CTsCALL. The result of the symmetric phase of the study validated the five-dimensional structure of CTsCALL and the four-dimensional structures of ITTEF in VE and CALL. It also revealed that language learners, who focused on the key information rather than the details while solving language tasks, as well as recognizing the pattern of task solving and applying them to other tasks, found VE, and CTsCALL to be aligned with their current capabilities, learning environment, and problem-solving skills that mediated their intention to learn and exchange information in this context in the future. Furthermore, the asymmetrical part of the study revealed that sixteen solutions are available to shape language learners' continued intention to use VE by combining the components of CTsCALL and ITTEF. Thus, the study developed the CTsCALL questionnaire and its theory into CALL together with the Council of Europe's Common European Framework of Reference for Languages and recommended that CALL researchers and educators take a broader view of VE, as well as continuing to validate CTsCALL in other CALL disciplines to show that this skill belongs to CALL as well.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is gaining increasing attention from researchers and practitioners all over the world to empower children in the digital era. However, there is no consensus on which components of CT to teach beginning coders in early childhood education (ECE). To address this issue, we conducted a systematic review of 42 empirical studies focused on teaching and assessing CT in ECE. We analyzed the included studies with the three-dimensional CT framework proposed by Brennan and Resnick (2012) and demonstrated how this framework could be modified to fit the context of ECE. Based on this systematic review, we sorted out the CT components that were proven suitable for young children to learn by incorporating emerging components and removing components inappropriate for young children. We thus proposed a CT curriculum framework for ECE that covers CT concepts (i.e., control flow/structures, representation, and hardware/software), CT practices (i.e., algorithmic design, pattern recognition, abstraction, debugging, decomposition, iteration, and generalizing), and CT perspectives (i.e., expressing and creating, connecting, perseverance, and choices of conduct). This systematic review and its associated CT curriculum framework provide important theoretical contributions and practical implications for early childhood CT education.

AB  - In this paper, we review and meta-analyze the findings of experimental studies published between 2006 and 2022 that examined the effects of coding and programming interventions on children's core and higher order executive functions (response inhibition, working memory, cognitive flexibility, planning and problem solving). The systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to address three research questions: 1) Which executive functions are most impacted by the teaching of CT? 2) Which instructional modality (educational robotics/virtual coding/unplugged coding) is most effective in enhancing executive function skills in learners aged 4–16 years? and 3) Does the cognitive effectiveness of coding vary with children's age? A total of 19 studies with 1523 participants met the selection criteria for the systematic review. The meta-analysis included 11 of those studies. The results reveal beneficial effects of structured virtual and tangible coding (educational robotics) activities for preschoolers and first graders, and significant effects of more unstructured virtual coding activities (e.g., Scratch-based) for older students. A multivariate fixed-effects model meta-analysis shows that the teaching of coding significantly improves problem-solving with the highest effect (dppc2 = 0.89), but also planning (dppc2 = 0.36), and inhibition and working memory with lower effects (dppc2 = 0.17, dppc2 = 0.20).

AB  - In light of the increasing importance digital economy, the significance of computational thinking has grown exponentially, becoming imperative in both workplace and academic settings such as universities. This article addresses the critical need to comprehend the factors influencing the acceptance of computational thinking. The dataset introduces an extensive questionnaire comprising five constructs and 25 items, rooted in the extended Technology Acceptance Model. Notably, the model incorporates facilitating conditions and subjective norm, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding acceptance. Data collection involved 132 undergraduate university students sampled through purposive sampling, specifically targeting courses with a focus on computational thinking. The resulting dataset serves as a valuable resource for future research, offering detailed insights into the factors determining the acceptance of technology in educational contexts beyond mere thinking skills. Given the scarcity of research on technology acceptance in developing nations, this dataset holds particular significance, serving as a foundation for potential cross-cultural comparisons. The dataset contributes to the field by presenting a robust acceptance model, explaining 74.2 per cent of the variance in behavioural intention, 60.2 per cent in perceived usefulness, and 56.1 per cent in perceived ease of use. This high explanatory power positions the dataset as a superior resource for replication, benchmarking, and broader applicability in diverse contexts, thereby enhancing the understanding of computational thinking acceptance across different populations and settings. This dataset stands among the pioneering efforts to assess the novel covariance-based structural equation model algorithm within SmartPLS 4, presenting a valuable resource for future research employing the same mechanism.

AB  - This paper describes a study designed to investigate the promise of resources that support the development of computational thinking (CT) in preschool children. This study was the culmination of a collaborative research process between researchers and media developers of a home-based intervention that included media and hands-on activities created to support the development of young children's CT. The mixed-methods study included 108 families, each with a 4- or 5-year-old child. Families, who participated in the study at home for six weeks, were randomly assigned to an intervention group that viewed media and engaged with hands-on activities with a CT focus or a control group that viewed and engaged with non-STEM literacy content. Data collection consisted of parent surveys, parent interviews, and CT learning and pre-coding tasks to assess children's CT abilities. Results indicate that the learning intervention demonstrates promise in supporting parental understanding of CT. Experience with the intervention over the six weeks also appeared to cultivate some CT strategy use in children as evidenced by parental reports and performance on learning and pre-coding sequencing tasks.

AB  - This study characterizes the literature on teaching computational thinking (CT) to preschoolers aged 4 to 5 years. Previous research and published systematic studies have provided important contributions about CT teaching to elementary and high school children. However, to date, there is no systematic overview of CT education for preschoolers. For this reason, this systematic mapping synthesizes 82 studies on CT teaching, through the implementation and evaluation of tools and activities to teach, improve or measure the CT knowledge acquired by children. Furthermore, studies on courses or training offered to preschool teachers related to the teaching of CT were also considered. From the selected studies, the following information was collected: year of publication; recovery sources and databases; vehicles and places of publication; temporal delimitation of research, research approach, nature and research method; CT teaching approaches; tools used to teach CT and how they are classified according to their physical characteristics and, finally, participants and individuals responsible for the research. The results suggest an increase in the number of publications in recent years, revealing the interest of researchers in the topic. Furthermore, we observed a trend towards the use of physical artifacts and the use of the disconnected computing approach to teaching CT skills to preschool children. The results also exposed that preschool teachers have little autonomy in implementing CT teaching activities because those are mostly implemented by computer professionals (researchers, teachers, etc.). This is because preschool teachers are still discouraged from teaching computer and technology-related content to children, considering them complex and disconnected from basic curricula. However, when teachers are trained to teach CT, they become interested in the content and become more active during the teaching process. We argue for integrating CT-related content into education curricula and supporting preschool teachers to implement it autonomously in their classrooms.

AB  - This paper deals within a context where technology plays a pivotal role in education. In this sense, it is essential to highlight the emergence of new competencies and skills in education due to technological advancements. Legislative frameworks have been developed to incorporate digital literacy, access to robotics, and computational thinking, between others. Hence, this review and meta-analysis aim at identifying the influence of robotics activities on computational thinking through a PRISMA-guided review. The findings reveal that interventions conducted in early childhood education significantly impact computational thinking. Results also showcase that, despite perceived barriers related to technology accessibility, the presence of legislation and contexts prioritizing these competencies is more relevant than the digital access gap.

AB  - Since computational thinking is a high-level cognitive skill and its conceptual framework has not yet been clarified, the assessment of this skill is problematic. While there is no consensus in the literature about the components of computational thinking, the abstraction component is located at a point where opinions intersect. In addition, it is predicted that computer science unplugged activities will improve computational thinking, and there is limited research examining this effect. As a result, this research aims to demonstrate the alleged effects of computer science unplugged activities on abstraction skill which is considered the critical component of computational thinking. The study, which was planned with a mixed methods research design, lasted 8 weeks. Quantitative data were obtained from the abstraction skill test developed by the researchers, while qualitative data were obtained from observations and task- based interviews after each activity. Quantitative findings showed that computer science unplugged activities significantly improve abstraction skills and thus computational thinking. Qualitative findings not only revealed that developments in the six abstracting steps caused this significant difference but also identified abstracting steps where the effect of each activity was limited. Suggestions for organizing activities to improve these steps are given. Finally, suggestions are presented for the conceptual framework of computational thinking based on abstraction.

AB  - The healthy development of cognitive functions, including executive functions, has been shown to depend mainly on the experiences and learning opportunities of people, especially during childhood. Over the past few years, researchers have been studying the impacts of diverse types of interventions on children’s cognitive development in which computational thinking programs are a recent field. This pilot study evaluated the effect of computational thinking training based on the “Programming for Children” program on the executive functions of children aged 10 and 11 years: working memory, inhibition, and planning (N = 30). The results showed that children in the experimental group improved on tests of visuospatial working memory, cognitive inhibition, and sequential planning compared with the control group. However, tests of verbal working memory, memory strategy, and visual spatial planning did not show any observed changes. Although this was an exploratory study, and its findings should be interpreted cautiously due to the small sample size, the findings support the relevance and feasibility of conducting similar larger studies with larger samples.

AB  - Computational thinking has been promoted as an impactful 21st-century skillset that can be transferred to many other disciplines and problem scenarios. With the proliferation of age-appropriate coding platforms for young children, computational thinking has become increasingly popular in early childhood settings. However, there is a lack of research on introducing coding and computational thinking to teacher training in early childhood education. To empower early childhood teachers in the digital society, this study introduced 17 early childhood teachers to robot programming and computational thinking through the ‘CT4ECE’ professional development program, which includes three phases: Learn, Practice, and Reflect & Improve. Results of pre- and post-intervention surveys revealed that the CT4ECE program significantly enhanced teachers' robotics and pedagogical knowledge, as well as their attitudes towards computational thinking, especially their interest in and their view of using computational thinking in classroom practice. Post-intervention interviews indicated that participation in CT4ECE helped educators gain a basic understanding of both coding robots and computational thinking suitable for young children due to a structured change process for teachers' professional learning. This study establishes a strong foundation for enhancing and expanding the CT4ECE program, ultimately equipping teachers and children with the necessary skillsets to thrive in the digital future.

AB  - The purpose of the current study is to investigate the effects of the unplugged computational thinking (CT) integrated STEM (UCT-STEM) approach and STEM approach on early childhood pre-service teachers’ CT skills (creativity, algorithmic thinking, critical thinking, problem solving, cooperativity, communication). The study was conducted with a total of 70 early childhood pre-service teachers. Quasi-experimental design was used; activities based on the UCT-STEM approach were administered to the experimental group and activities based on the STEM approach were administered to the control group. Post-test scores for CT skills showed a statistically significant difference in favour of the experimental group. It was concluded that the UCT-STEM approach was more effective in developing the pre-service teachers’ CT skills than the STEM approach. The current study presents an important finding to the literature in terms of the developed STEM and UCT-STEM contents and how these contents improve pre-service teachers’ CT skills. The STEM and UCT-STEM content provides significant information in terms of teacher practices. At the same time, this study offers important implications for program developers and policy-makers to integrate these innovative educational approaches into both early childhood education and teacher education programs.

AB  - The integration of computational thinking (CT) to enhance creativity in design students has often been underexplored in design education. While design thinking has traditionally been the cornerstone of university design pedagogy and remains essential, the increasing role of digital tools and artificial intelligence in modern design practices presents new opportunities for innovation. By introducing CT alongside design thinking, students can expand their creative toolkit and engage with emerging technologies more effectively. Although many design students may have limited experience with programming, incorporating accessible, no-code tools can help them confidently embrace computational methods, unlocking new pathways for creative exploration and innovation. This study proposes an alternative approach to improve the motivation of design students by introducing machine learning tools into product design processes. We developed an experimental pedagogy in which 56 industrial design university students learned how to use Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (Weka), a machine learning tool, for three hours of design work a week, for a total of eight weeks. Our covariate analysis of data collected in the pretest and posttest shows that the general learning motivations in the group using Weka are significantly higher than those in the group without Weka. However, no significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of learning strategies, collaboration, or critical thinking. Students using Weka spent more time focusing on model training and tended to improve their algorithmic thinking, and the introduction of Weka appeared to enhance their motivation to learn. On the other hand, these students might have been focusing on working individually at their computers, potentially neglecting communication and collaboration. The findings suggest that teaching machine learning applications without requiring coding has the potential to boost design students' motivation to engage with CT skills, though care must be taken to maintain collaborative practices.

AB  - There is increasing effort to integrate Computational Thinking (CT) curricula across all education levels. Therefore, research on CT assessment has lately progressed towards developing and validating reliable CT assessment tools, which are crucial for evaluating students' potential learning progress and thus the effectiveness of suggested curricular programs. Several CT assessment tools were developed for elementary, high-school, and university students over the last years. Moreover, associations between CT scores and other cognitive abilities were unraveled. However, studies on the topic in primary school level are scarce. Like the general concept of intelligence, CT remains broadly defined as the ability to combine algorithmic operations to form complex solutions in order to solve problems effectively, utilizing concepts of computer science with or without the use of computers. In this study, we aimed at specifying a cognitive definition of CT, focusing on the under-investigated population of primary school children. Since validated assessment tools for this age group were not available, we adapted a validated CT test, which was initially designed for middle school students. In our study participated 192 third and fourth graders. The analyses revealed promising results on the reliability of the adapted CT assessment for primary school students. Moreover, findings indicated CT's positive associations with i. complex numerical abilities, ii. verbal reasoning abilities, and iii. non-verbal visuospatial abilities. Our results indicate similarities but also differences in associations of CT with other cognitive abilities in primary school children compared to other age groups. In summary: i. numerical abilities seem to associate with CT at the primary school level, whereas this seems not the case later on in education, ii. verbal abilities seem to associate with CT both along primary and secondary education levels, and iii. non-verbal reasoning abilities seem to associate with CT from primary education level to the university level and beyond. These differences imply that several basic cognitive abilities support CT abilities and CT development differentially across ages.

AB  - The concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI), born as the possibility of simulating the human brain's learning capabilities, quickly evolves into one of the educational technology concepts that provide tools for students to better themselves in a plethora of areas. Unlike the previous educational technology iterations, which are limited to instrumental use for providing platforms to build learning applications, AI has proposed a unique education laboratory by enabling students to explore an instrument that functions as a dynamic system of computational concepts. However, the extent of the implications of AI adaptation in modern education is yet to be explored. Motivated to fill the literature gap and to consider the emerging significance of AI in education, this paper aims to analyze the possible intertwined relationship between students’ intrinsic motivation for learning Artificial Intelligence during the COVID-19 pandemic; the relationship between students’ computational thinking and understanding of AI concepts; and the underlying dynamic relation, if existing, between AI and computational thinking building efforts. To investigate the mentioned relationships, the present empirical study employs mediation analysis based upon collected 137 survey data from Universidad Politécnica de Madrid students in the Institute for Educational Science and the School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering during the first quarter of 2022. Findings show that intrinsic motivation mediates the relationship between perceived Artificial Intelligence learning and computational thinking. Also, the research indicates that intrinsic motivation has a significant relationship with computational thinking and perceived Artificial Intelligence learning.

AB  - Computational thinking is widely recognized as an essential skill for adapting to the current era, with programming learning being the most effective means to develop it. It is recommended that computational thinking and learning programming be introduced as early as elementary school. However, elementary school students often possess limited prior knowledge of programming, posing challenges in their learning process. The graphic organizers (GOs) may serve as a bridge between students’ existing knowledge and new learning, facilitating a deeper processing of the overall information and thereby enhancing the learning process. This can be particularly advantageous for early-stage learners when grappling with difficult subjects. Consequently, this study employed GOs to assist elementary school students in their computational thinking and programming learning, employing a quasi-experiment design to evaluate their effectiveness. The results showed that although all students demonstrated awareness of applying computational thinking to solve problems, those exposed to GO-based instruction exhibited higher levels of computational thinking, programming skills, and flow experiences.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) practices is a critical cognitive tool for students to overcome challenges in this technological era. Few studies investigated CT practices from a development perspective. A two-year intervention was implemented in 30 intervention and 22 control schools in Hong Kong to promote CT education (T1baseline: N = 13,056; T2: N = 16,367; and T3: N = 15,269). Senior primary students (grades 4 to 6) around 8–12 years old were targeted. Among them, 34% were girls at T1baseline. Their learning progression of cognitive development was assessed with a CT practices test. Data were analyzed using item response analysis. Learning trajectories of CT practices were modeled to understand how students’ cognitive development differed between schools. Insights of findings were discussed in bringing CT practices to life.

AB  - Engagement is critical to computational thinking and programming education. However, as multi-dimensional variables, when analyzing how different aspects of engagement in computational thinking tasks influence skills development, it becomes crucial to discern precisely which engagement components intersect with the progression of computational thinking skills. This discernment is pivotal because engagement can vary based on the task nature, the context, and the individual's preferences. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the gender differences in engagement and computational thinking skills and the predictive relationships among these sub-dimensions for boys and girls in an unplugged environment. In this study, a quasi-experiment for 90 sixth-grade students from a north Chinese primary school was performed. By partial least squares–structural equation modeling, students’ models of computational thinking skills and engagement were analyzed, and comparisons of boys and girls were made by analysis of covariance statistics. Results indicated that compared with boys, girls reported higher computational thinking performance and more engagement in unplugged contexts. Furthermore, girls’ computational thinking skills were only predicted by their cognitive engagement, whereas boys’ computational thinking skills were predicted by their behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement. Teachers can adopt these findings to design computational thinking teaching interventions that combine the advantages of unplugged activity and focus on the engagement of boys and girls.

AB  - In this work, we argue for expanding the scope of K-12 computational thinking (CT) integration contexts to include everyday scenarios involving moral reasoning. Epistemic overlap between computational thinking practices and moral reasoning suggest that these contexts are potentially rich sites to see “seeds of CT” in children's reasoning and can provide rich educational pathways for children into CT. Taking a case-study approach, we examine the reasoning of a second-grader, Ollie, on a task involving fair allocation of resources to victims of a natural disaster. Our analysis finds that Ollie's reasoning was rich with seeds of CT (e.g., problem formulation, abstraction, complex-systems thinking) and that empathy served as an important supporting role to the CT. This work has implications for curricular design, suggesting that fairness and resource allocation scenarios with built-in opportunities for empathy might provide rich sandboxes for CT integration.

AB  - Although there are different definitions for computational thinking in the literature, it is possible to define it mainly as problem solving, designing and interpreting new systems by thinking like a computer. According to Wing (2006), computational thinking is a way of designing a system and understanding human behaviors by focusing on the basic concepts of the computer sciences. The recent focus on computational thinking as a key 21 st century skill for all students has led to a number of curriculum initiatives to embed it in K-12 classrooms and to introduce computing ideas to students early during their schooling years. The present study aims to explore the effects of a short, intensive coding and robotics training on the computational thinking skill self-efficacy of middle school students. 24 fifth graders participated in the study and data were collected by means of the Computational Thinking Self-efficacy scale (CTS) and one open-ended question. Analyses of the pre, post and delayed tests revealed significant differences between the pre and post-tests.

AB  - Methodological innovations across social sciences are opening new avenues for conducting research designed to address real-world challenges. The benefits of utilizing the Design-Based Implementation Research (DBIR) approach in public libraries to resolve a persistent problem of practice, a lack of assessment tools to evaluate youth Computational Thinking (CT) programs, is demonstrated. Findings from a three-year, three-phased study utilizing the DBIR approach to design and implement a suite of assessment tools to assess CT programming in public libraries are presented. Guided by the four principles of the DBIR approach, this research produced new knowledge, including identifying CT program outcomes, challenges, and recommendations for designing and implementing assessment tools to measure the impact of public libraries' CT programming. Findings underscore the DBIR approach as a strategy for engaging with practitioners and helping shift their perspectives by resolving practice problems and facilitating the design of sustainable solutions.

AB  - Although there is controversy surrounding rewards and competition in education, they are key elements in digital game-based learning (DGBL). Research on the influence of rewards and competition in DGBL often yields mixed results, suggesting a need to investigate individual game elements and their interactions. This study implemented DGBL focusing on computational thinking (CT) in 7th-grade classes. Both quantitative and behavioral data were collected to understand the impact of rewards (power-up or customization) and competition (with or without) on students’ intrinsic motivation, game performance, behaviors, and CT skills. The findings uncovered significant interactions between rewards and competition. Students with both competition and power-up rewards achieved the highest game points but the lowest CT performance, whereas those exposed to the same power-up rewards without competition attained the lowest game points but the best CT performance. Implications are drawn for DGBL research and practice.

AB  - Despite growing interest in early childhood computational thinking (CT), there is a lack of validated assessments for children who are emerging readers. This paper presents validity and reliability evidence of a performance-based assessment of CT using item response theory (IRT) from 272 children aged 4–8. Using a two-parameter logistic model IRT model (2PL IRT), we confirmed that model- and item-level fits are acceptable. Item analyses revealed a high discriminability (M = 2.26, SD = 1.12) and a moderate item difficulty (M = −0.21; SD = 0.86), on average, across 19 items. Reliability analysis demonstrated that the assessment was substantially reliable (marginal reliability: rxx = 0.87). Differential item functioning (DIF) analyses indicated that the assessment estimated children's item parameters fairly, regardless of their gender and age. However, we confirmed gaps in latent ability (θ) of CT by gender and age: boys showed higher latent ability of CT than girls, and old children (above 72 months) showed higher latent ability than young children (below 72 months). Findings suggest the assessment is a fair measure that can serve as a reliable and valid tool to assess CT for children who are emerging readers.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is an important and essential skill for human beings to master in the 21st century. Although CT has received wide attention since this concept was proposed, the current theoretical models have not well defined the complex relations between CT and other cognitive abilities for young children. To provide insight into this gap, the current study proposed a model in which we hypothesized that CT was significantly related to arithmetic fluency that is viewed as an important domain of mathematics. Additionally, arithmetic fluency was predicted to mediate the relations of CT to other cognitive abilities, including reasoning and creativity. This study tested such direct and indirect relations in children aged 5–6 years. Consistent with previous studies on older age groups, the results showed that CT and arithmetic fluency were significantly related to each other and both were significantly related to reasoning ability and creative thinking as well. Moreover, this study, for the first time, indicated that arithmetic fluency totally mediated the relation between CT and reasoning ability, suggesting that these concepts share conceptual commonalities, such as the cognitive processes related to mathematics or/and abstraction; in contrast, arithmetic fluency did not mediate the relation between CT and creative thinking, suggesting that gaining CT skill may exert direct positive effect on the development of creativity. Therefore, despite the root in computer science, CT is associated with many cognitive and learning abilities in other domains, supporting the importance of including CT into early school education.

AB  - There has been growing interest in assessing computational thinking (CT) across diverse learners beyond the traditional forms of tests and assignments. Learning games offer the potential for innovative, stealth assessments of students' implicit learning from gameplay behaviors. This paper reports on the measurement of implicit CT practices demonstrated by upper elementary- and middle-school students as they play the CT learning game Zoombinis. The process of using the gameplay log data to build valid automated detectors of students' implicit CT practices is discussed. Findings from this study provide implications for analyzing gameplay behaviors at scale, leading to the development of models for the assessment of implicit STEM learning.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is critical for Twenty-first century life. Ensuring equitable access to CT depends on preparing teachers to integrate CT into disciplinary curricula. We report on the design, evaluation, and outcomes of the Computational Thinking Unplugged for Science (CT-UP-S) professional development program for inservice science teachers. Our process-based approach to CT significantly improved teachers CT understanding and CT/science integration self-efficacy by systematically linking CT practices to scaffold the generation of unplugged algorithms. Additionally, we found that the process-based approach provided a framework for teachers' lesson planning and that teachers’ content knowledge moderated their ability to write CT-integrated science lessons.

AB  - Early evidence suggests that robot programming offers an important foundation for spatial reasoning and computational thinking; however, researchers have debated how to introduce young children to these skills. We explored how preschoolers develop understanding of spatial concepts and computational thinking as the children took turns navigating a path during guided play with a programmable robot. Our analysis of the data included a multimodal visualization of the exchanges between the teacher, children, and a programmable robotic device. The findings highlight the effects that arose from the physical-digital convergence of technology integrated into play including: (a) the robot evoked a chain of actions, enacting pedagogic forces that transformed children's learning; (b) children used their own bodies as spatial referents, co-locating themselves in space with the robot; (c) the teacher remained a key actor, providing verbal and nonverbal scaffolding to promote children's understanding and mastery of spatial and computational concepts; and (d) talking with the teacher about spatial concepts combined with the interactions with the robot enhanced children's acquisition of spatial ideas relative to the quantity of children's verbal expressions and complexity of their applied spatial skills and computational thinking.

AB  - Workers in the areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics play a significant role in the sustained growth and stability of the global economy, and, thus constitute a critical component in helping all countries worldwide to prosper. In this context, computational thinking constitutes an important skill to have as it enables workers to develop creative solutions to complex problems. Nonetheless, across all economies worldwide, there is a need to have more workers who are able to think through problems, challenges, and solutions in computational terms. It is thus of utmost importance to integrate the teaching of computational thinking in K-12 education in order to reduce the skills gap between education and the workplace. A pertinent and crucial question that arises is whether teachers have the knowledge and skills to teach students how to think computationally. Existing research shows that teacher education departments do not currently have the knowledge to promote computational thinking in their programs. The present study focuses on two aspects of computational thinking, such as, algorithmic thinking and debugging skills with the use of scaffolded programming scripts in an educational technology undergraduate course. The results show statistically significant learning gains in pre-service teachers’ algorithmic thinking and debugging skills in the context of robotic programming activities with LEGO WeDo. Limitations and future research directions are discussed.

AB  - Recent studies identify Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) as a key factor in enhancing cognitive development, particularly within Computational Thinking (CT) literature. However, research gaps remain in understanding how SRL and CT interact from a developmental perspective. Our study designed a program with tailored animations and worksheets to specifically foster students' learning and cognitive development. Using a mixed-methods approach, we administered surveys among 1235 students from 29 Hong Kong primary schools to investigate a dynamic learning system comprising SRL and CT in a large-scale CT program. Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 students to further probe insights. Quantitative findings revealed a mutually reinforcing relationship in the dynamic system, suggesting that higher SRL skills enhance cognitive CT abilities, and vice versa. Complementing these results, qualitative findings showed that integrating animations and worksheets into the CT program significantly boosted students' SRL and cognitive development. These findings have significant implications for educational practices and curriculum design. Schools should consider implementing SRL strategies, such as proactive goal setting and reflective evaluation, within their curricula to promote students’ cognitive development. Furthermore, strategic investments in educational technology, including collaborations with EdTech developers, are essential to create effective, pedagogically sound tools that enhance learning outcomes. These insights provide valuable guidance for creating a supportive SRL environment that fosters cognitive development in primary school education.

AB  - In recent years, there has been increasing interest in integrating Computational Thinking (CT) into elementary schools. However, few studies have focused on teachers’ perceptions. This study aims to examine teachers' perceptions to bridge the gap between theory and practice. The study analysed teachers’ perceptions of integrating CT into school subjects through the constructionist approach, using Scratch a leading programming platform inspired by Resnick's Lifelong Kindergarten Constructionist model. Over a school year, 31 teachers participated in a professional development program and applied this model in their classrooms. The teachers were interviewed to capture their perceptions of learning and teaching using a constructionist method. The findings revealed that teachers with creative arts experience fully embraced the model, while others partially adopted it. Teachers recognized the benefits of constructionist teaching in fostering creativity, motivation, and engagement among students. However, they struggled with balancing these benefits with school demands and constraints. Challenges included managing time effectively within constraints of school and ensuring curriculum alignment. Despite this, many teachers found that the constructionist approach positively impacted students' learning engagement and personal development. By addressing the identified challenges, teacher education designers, curriculum developers, and schools can develop practices for closing the gap between theory and practice.

AB  - Educational research on predicting learners’ computer programming performance has yielded practical implications that guide task designs in computer education. There have been attempts to investigate learners’ computer programming patterns using high-frequency and automated data collection. This approach can be considered as process-based analysis as opposed to outcome-based analysis (i.e., the use of test or exam scores). In this process-based approach to investigate learners’ computer programming process, we included two critical constructs in our research, self-regulated learning and computational thinking skills. We aimed to identify learners’ computer programming patterns in the context that novice students learn a computer programming language, Python, in an online coding environment. We examined the relationships between the learners’ coding patterns, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills. Initially, we adopted a traditional approach with the aggregate data of learners’ computer programming behaviors. We then utilized a computational analytics approach to learner performance, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills, with ever-changing computer programming patterns. In our initial approach, the indicators of aggregate computer programming data were not associated with learners' learning performance and computational thinking skills. In the computational analysis approach, many indicators revealed significant differences between the identified patterns regarding computational thinking skills and self-regulated learning. Recommendations about the use of programming log data analysis methods and future scaffolding for computer programming learners are addressed.

AB  - In the field of education, research has consistently emphasized mathematical creative thinking as a crucial component of 21st-century skills. Thus, this cross-sectional study examines the predictors of such thinking by specifically focusing on the roles of perceived creativity, creative self-efficacy, and computational thinking. The participants consisted of 896 secondary school students (52.9 % female; 47.1 % male) in Indonesia who were asked to complete a series of online questionnaires and tests. For analysis, structural equation modeling was employed, demonstrating satisfactory construct validity and instrument reliability. Based on the results, there was a positive association between computational thinking and mathematical creative thinking. In addition, perceived creativity had a positive impact on mathematical creative thinking, whereas creative self-efficacy showed a negative association. As for the empirical model, it revealed that computational thinking plays a mediating role, connecting perceived creativity and creative self-efficacy to mathematical creative thinking. The findings suggest that incorporating these skills and related variables into the mathematics curriculums in schools is essential for preparing students for success in the 21st century.

AB  - Previous studies have explored the relationship between computational thinking (CT) and creativity. However, a consensus has yet to be reached since both CT and creativity varied in ideation and assessment. To uncover the cognitive mechanism underlying the interplay between CT and creativity, we conduct a scoping review of 26 empirical studies published in 2006–2024. Our findings suggested that the effects of working memory varied in the interplay between CT and creativity due to differences in age range, neural network activation regions, and measurements. Intellectual abilities, including algorithmic fluency, reasoning ability, and coding ability, showed cognitive transfer effect on CT skills but not necessarily on creativity, suggesting that cognitive abilities embracing more intelligent elements may contribute to the functional connectivity in CT neural networks but only partly overlapped with creativity involved networks. Although executive functions (working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control) play a crucial role in both CT and creativity, their contributions to the CT-creativity interplay are still rarely studied. Future research should explore the CT-creativity relationship from the perspective of neuroscience.

Sixty-six papers were selected for this systematic review and analyzed for patterns in relation to the implementation of CS education in K-12 schools and its impact on the development of students’ CT skills. Although educational interventions have not always been successful in CS education, this review provides strong evidence that overall, CS education promotes the development of students’ CT in the K-12 setting while improving their creative and critical thinking skills. We recommend early access to CS education, various innovative instructional approaches to CS education and appropriate support and guidance for student learning.

AB  - Recently, the development of computational thinking (CT) skills has become widespread in the whole world. There is a consensus to develop students’ CT skills through unplugged and plugged-in programming. However, the choice of programming approaches taught in schools is arbitrary and few studies have compared the effectiveness differences between unplugged and plugged-in programming. This study aimed to explore the differences between unplugged and plugged-in programming in developing CT skills of students in Grades 1-2 students. It also explored the joint effects of students’ gender, programming experience, programming interest, and programming confidence with different programming approaches on CT skills. The quasi-experimental research approach was used to conduct 10 weeks of unplugged, plugged-in, and regular programming activities with 124 Grades 1-2 students. The results found that unplugged programming promoted CT skills more in the early primary grades than plugged-in programming. We found that boys and students with programming experience in unplugged group performed significantly better in CT skills than in plugged-in group. Moreover, the improvement of CT skills of students in unplugged group was positively correlated with the level of their programming interest and programming confidence. However, these were not observed in plugged-in group. The results of this study can provide precise guidance for teaching CT skills to early primary school students and provide references for CT education.

AB  - This paper presents an investigation that compares and analyzes the interactions of three groups of pre-and-primary school children with three different storytelling systems. We identify emerging patterns through which they engaged in what we refer to as narrative computational thinking. The latter describes broadened aspects of narrative literacy practices that are linked to computational thinking. By applying a multicase study approach and through various vignettes, we illustrate how children applied computational thinking to understand and influence the narrative possibilities offered by the different tools. Our results illustrate circumstances under which digital storytelling activities provide a favorable basis for narrative computational thinking, and that when computational thinking functions as a scaffold for story creation, it encourages a blend of creativity and computational thinking, providing a compelling approach to introducing emerging digital literacies to young children in a narrative context.

AB  - In this study, it is aimed to identify the computational thinking skills used by gifted and talented students in integrated STEM activities based on the EDP. The case study design, a qualitative research method, is employed in the study. The participants consist of gifted and talented students attending the Science and Arts Center. Integrated STEM activities based on the EDP were conducted over the course of ten weeks and among these activities, robotic and 3D modeling-based robot construction activities using Lego sets are addressed in the present study. The STEM activity booklet, researchers' fieldnotes, and teaching process video recordings were used as data collection tools in the study. Data that was collected was analyzed through content analysis. It was seen that gifted and talented students participating in integrated STEM activities based on the EDP make active use of critical thinking skills while providing explanations, making associations, questioning information, giving justifications, solving problems, thinking creatively, making generalizations, and attempting to convince others; as for the instances of defining problems, creating solutions, and evaluating the effectiveness of the solution, the students were observed to actively use their problem-solving skills. The detailed account provided by the study on the way robotic and 3D robot modeling activities improve the computational thinking skills of gifted and talented students contributes to the required educational support and to the existing body of literature.

AB  - In the artificial intelligence age, cultivating young children's computational thinking (CT) has sparked tremendous attention. Programmable robotics is a developmental-appropriate and screen-free means that provides young children with great opportunities to learn programming and develop CT. However, it is reported that young children might have difficulties learning abstract CT concepts. As a helpful pedagogical facilitator, metaphors can help turn abstract concepts into more concrete and clear concepts that learners are familiar with. Therefore, this research proposed a metaphor-based robot programming (MRP) approach and explored its impact on young children's CT and behavioral patterns. A total of 118 children aged 5–6 were recruited in this experiment with two conditions: the experimental group adopted the metaphor-based robot programming (MRP) approach while the control group used the conventional robot programming (CRP) approach. Results revealed that children who adopted the MRP approach outperformed children who adopted the CRP approach on CT. In addition, behavioral analysis indicated that the proposed MRP approach could facilitate children's superior learning performance and more positive learning behaviors, so as to help them achieve learning objectives. Accordingly, this study can provide insightful guidance and inspiration for future research on effective programming teaching and CT development for young children.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is a necessary skill for students. It is as important as the other essential skills such as reading, writing, and arithmetic. However, how to improve students’ CT in robotics is still to be explored. Hence, this study examined the effects of computer supported project-based learning (CSPBL) on students’ CT and learning engagement through comparing students’ CT and engagement in two courses instructed by the same instructor (one instructed with a traditional method, the other instructed with CSPBL). Participants were seventy-nine students from a university in China. Questionnaires, interviews, and project analysis were used to measure students’ CT and learning engagement. The comparative results of self-reports and final projects indicated that the CSPBL enhanced students’ CT. The simulation project training based on the SenseStudy learning platform in CSPBL helped students debug the programming code, optimize the algorithm design, and improve their algorithmic thinking, cooperation, and problem solving during the program error correction. The CSPBL also improved students’ engagement in learning, especially for those with more than one year of programming experience. It was found that the CSPBL was effective in terms of improving students’ CT and engagement in robotics learning. This study provides teachers with practical suggestions to conduct effective robotics instruction.

AB  - Malaysia has introduced computational thinking skills as part of a curriculum integration update to meet the global trends in 21st-century education, focusing on empowering digital literacy. Nevertheless, a preliminary investigation revealed an apparent lack of understanding of computational thinking skills in general among teachers. The study explores the feasibility of developing a localized E-learning system to train computational thinking skills among teachers. An E-learning system, termed as myCTGWBL, was developed on the basis of a newly proposed conceptual framework to present computational thinking teaching–learning repertoire to the teachers. The hypothesis is that myCTGWBL would develop teachers' computational thinking and its position in teaching–learning understanding. myCTGWBL relevance was tested through DeLone and McLean's information system and Urbach's collaboration quality construct. To determine the success factors, partial least squares structural equation modeling was used. A total of 369 teachers participated in a two-stage survey. Participants' understanding of computational thinking and perceptions were recorded at the pre- and post-intervention phases. Open-ended questions of the surveys were analyzed using a simple text analysis technique. The closed-ended questions surveys were analyzed using SPSS Statistics 22.0. A significant improvement in teachers' computational thinking teaching–learning repertoire in a relatively short period has been recorded. Teachers also demonstrated increased confidence in the future delivering computational thinking-based lessons. The E-learning conceptual framework has illustrated the predictive power between user intent, user satisfaction, and Computational thinking (CT) knowledge benefits. Results demonstrate that myCTGWBL could be used to guide future planning when establishing CT knowledge acquisition initiatives, particularly among teachers.

AB  - Efforts to incorporate computational thinking (CT) into academic courses have been gaining popularity. CT is a problem-solving skill that is crucial in the 21st century. CT may be used to support language education. Courses in English as a foreign language often need an effective writing component that includes writing organization and language use, as demonstrated by the poor writing samples often generated by students of these courses. To address the problems, CT, which is a higher-order mode of problem-solving and knowledge acquisition optimization, was used. The experimental group was instructed using the CT teaching model based on CT's essential components (decomposition, generalization, abstraction, algorithm, and evaluation), whereas the control group was taught using the conventional method. In total, 58 undergraduate students divided into two groups participated in this study. A combination of writing, CT skills, surveys, and interviews were used to collect data according to an experimental design. The collected quantitative data were analyzed through analysis of covariance and structural equation modeling, and the MAXQDA 2022software was used to analyze the collected qualitative data. The results of this study indicate that incorporating CT into an English writing course enhances the writing and higher-order thinking skills of students. The CT concepts helps students develop critical thinking skills by evaluating the text and identifying potential issues or improvements. Additionally, it allows students to use their skills to create unique writing solutions, which can boost English writing creativity.

AB  - Computational thinking education has become an increasingly popular topic among practitioners and researchers. However, rare is known how to effectively teach and learn computational thinking in early childhood education. To address this knowledge gap, this systematic review examined 26 studies on the teaching and learning of computational thinking in early childhood education from 2010 to 2022. The content knowledge, tools, pedagogical design, assessment methods, and learning outcomes were analyzed. Results indicated that, with age-appropriate instructional design, children could develop early concepts and skills of computational thinking, as well as other related skills such as communication, collaboration, and problem solving. Across the studies, we found that most studies used quantitative research methods, with direct assessment and observation being the most. Several challenges were identified: (1) achieving a deeper learning of computational thinking; (2) a lack of valid and reliable computational thinking assessments for children with a wider age range; (3) selecting appropriate learning tools; and (4) designing age-appropriate activities for young learners. Although with these challenges, computational thinking education could bring new learning opportunities and enhance children's computational thinking skills, as well as other non-cognitive skills such as critical thinking, body-material interaction, and hand-eye coordination. This systematic review informs future endeavors in theorizing a digital learning framework that can integrate computational thinking into early childhood education.

AB  - Teacher competencies encompass the dimensions of knowledge and attitudes, yet few studies have analysed teachers' latent profiles in relation to the interaction between these two dimensions. Latent profile analysis, which examines the interplay between variables to distinguish subgroups of individuals, has recently emerged in studies of computational thinking (CT) as a method for identifying student profiles. However, the latent profiles of CT teachers have not yet been analysed. We therefore analysed the latent profiles of a sample of 493 teachers who had participated in a teacher development programme in CT, according to their knowledge and perceived usefulness of CT. Three profiles were identified: (1) highly knowledgeable with high perceived usefulness, (2) knowledgeable with low perceived usefulness, and (3) less knowledgeable with low perceived usefulness. Qualitative data further triangulated these findings. We also examined the learning achievement of 12,105 students taught by these teachers. Students taught by highly knowledgeable teachers with a high perceived sense of usefulness demonstrated significantly better achievement than their peers. Our findings highlight the importance of nurturing both knowledge of and perceived usefulness in CT. They also provide valuable insights for similar teacher development programmes, emphasizing the importance of peer mentoring support for less knowledgeable teachers. Additionally, we underscore the value of having teachers create artefacts using CT for instructional purposes, allowing them to gain firsthand experience of its usefulness. As few studies have explored teachers' latent profiles based on the dimensions of knowledge and attitudes, the contribution of this study extends beyond the domain of CT.

AB  - We designed a controlled trial protocol that seeks to contribute to cognitive science by studying the effect of thought training on children's executive functions. The study design is a cluster randomized controlled trial, with intra-subject and inter-subject evaluation, with two parallel groups: an experimental group and a TAU control group. With three measures, pre-test, post-test, and follow-up after three months. The participants will be children aged 9 to 11. The allocation will be randomized by groups and not individually. The sample will be a minimum of 44 participants. The primary measures will be neuropsychological tests to assess executive functions. Secondary measures will be a computational thinking test, neuropsychological tests to assess metacognition and attention, and an acceptability scale. The experimental group will participate in the COGNI-MACHINE computational thinking training designed by the first author. The training frequency will be twice a week in 60 min sessions for 12 weeks. The TAU control group will receive computer science classes as usual during the same time as the experimental group. The evaluators taking the measurements will be blinded to the assignment. The investigators in charge of the intervention will be blinded to the results of the evaluations.

AB  - Negative feedback can temporarily relieve negative Chinese transfer (NCT) in English as a foreign language (EFL) syntactic writing by focusing only on the surface writing constructs, neglecting that EFL writing is an embodiment of the process by which higher-order thinking operates. To solve the problem, the researchers conducted a pretest, interventionist group dynamic assessment (IGDA) in the form of negative feedback based on computational thinking (CT), higher-order thinking, and post-test quasi-experimental design, with a control group receiving the direct correction feedback instructing model to mitigate the NCT in EFL syntactic writing. We analyzed the syntactic writing types and frequencies of the NCT obtained through repeated-measure ANOVA and confirmed by qualitative data through video recording. The results indicated that IGDA in the form of negative feedback based on CT principal skills could (1) significantly decrease syntactic writing errors caused by the NCT, (2) improve learners’ EFL writing performance, and finally, (3) elevate the computer as an essential mediation tool. This innovative instructing mode of intervening with writing constructs and higher-order thinking and bringing about deeper thinking and creativity contributes to the EFL writing teaching methodology in a foreign language higher education.

AB  - The tenure system in the United States places significant importance on teaching effectiveness. To date, students' evaluations of teaching (SETs) have been the reigning mechanism for assessing effective teaching. However, prior work has shown that SETs are often biased against underrepresented groups and minorities. The present study analyzes options for effective teaching assessments, which include evaluating final grades and measuring the differences between students’ pre- and post-tests (normalized gain) using standard instruments. The content area and the instrument used in this study originated in the computational thinking field, which has a widespread presence in engineering, where minorities are at a disadvantage. This study obtained a total of 88 student participants from four sections of an introductory engineering course at a Southwestern institution. The study utilized a computational thinking diagnostic (CTD) to inform the course teaching approach (the intervention). Results show that (a) normalized learning gains correlated moderately with SETs, (b) final grades correlated strongly with SETs, (c) final grades correlated strongly with normalized learning gains, (d) the educational intervention based on the CTD significantly affected student learning, and (e) SET comments affect evaluations. The implications include the notion that standardized instrument-driven instruction and evaluations can increase the success of minorities on both sides of the classroom. The purpose of this manuscript is to invite the Heliyon readership to get involved in the development of related instruments and to incorporate these measures of learning into their instruction so biases are avoided or minimized.

AB  - In the digital age, our lives become more dependent on technology, yet the digital gap is intensifying especially because most people lack digital literacy. As a modest step to handle this challenge, we designed a course named "Play with me in Code" to develop pre-service teachers' (PSTs) thinking skills and expose them to learning by creation using computational thinking and programming as part of the constructionism paradigm. The added value of using Scratch in the context of teacher education lies not only in familiarity with a programming language but with an emphasis on experiencing self-directed learning tackling with problem solving situations, creativity, socioemotional competencies, and logical computational thinking. The present study aims to examine 25 PSTs' attitudes towards facing challenges of coding with Scratch. To this end, a mixed-method approach was activated by using questionnaires, blog posts, and reflections. Findings revealed that the learning environment encouraged PSTs' use of abstraction and decomposition to address a complex problem or to design a complex game. Study's conclusions relate to the importance of providing PSTs opportunities to experience learning by programming for raising their awareness of the importance of enhancing thinking skills and creativity in the future.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT), a way to think about solving problems, is recognized as a basic skill for the 21st century. Although game-based learning (GBL) has been shown to improve student's CT skills, students may fail to self-evaluate or debate as they play games, thus failing to develop higher-order thinking. Also not widely explored is how teachers are to practice the CT core competencies during the learning process to cultivate students' problem-solving thinking. As the adoption of student-generated questions (SGQ) is an instructional strategy to promote higher-order thinking, we develop a GBL platform that uses this strategy to enhance students' CT skills, learning motivation, and learning confidence. For this purpose, fifty-three primary school students were recruited for this study, and data were collected during four classes of experimental CT activities. This study shows that the experimental group using the SGQ strategy with a GBL platform exhibited significantly higher CT skills than the control group. In addition, with respect to learning motivation and learning confidence it is found that the experimental group also outperformed the control group. This confirms that integrating the SGQ strategy and CT core competencies fosters higher-order cognitive thinking in students in problem-solving through gamification of the learning environment, resulting in higher motivation and confidence to complete experimental activities.

AB  - To effectively utilize artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies such as ChatGPT and realize their novel ethical issues, individuals must have a variety of knowledge and skills about AI. Such knowledge and skills have led to the emergence of AI literacy. Despite the importance of AI literacy in everyday life, little is known about its determinants. To better understand the determinants of AI literacy, we attempted to build a research model relying on previous research and different theoretical frameworks. The model incorporated digital divide, cognitive absorption, and computational thinking. As a major finding from the current study, computational thinking was found to be a significant determinant of AI literacy, which facilitate using, recognizing, and evaluating AI-based technologies. Moreover, we found out that individuals with physical access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) are more expected to use and recognize AI. Also, motivation and skills in using ICTs enable individuals to better evaluate the outcomes of AI-based technologies. The findings also showed that convenient access to ICTs contributes to a deep involvement with AI-based technologies in the use. Further, individuals with higher motivation and skills to use AI technologies are likely to have a pleasant experience after using these technologies.

AB  - Both computational thinking (CT) and creativity have been recognized as key skills for today's learners. Over the last decade, research of both skills in a single context has emerged. In this paper, we present a scoping review of 62 such empirical from 2011 to 2020. Our goal was to have a thorough understanding of the educational settings in which research on both CT and creativity was conducted, the theoretical foundations it has laid down, and the research tools used. Our findings indicate a geographical bias (dominance of the US and prominence of developed European countries), as well as a focus on secondary education and on STEM-related disciplines; this could be explained by the current situation of CT spread. We also found that when studying CT and creativity jointly, it is most common to define CT in a broader perspective than merely programming of computer science. Additionally, while creativity is largely referred to as product-related, CT is barely referred to as such. Taken together, our findings point out some gaps in the current research of CT and creativity and suggest how it should be expended on the fertile grounds of creativity, as the latter crosses geographical, age, and subject borders. Doing so may build a bridge between CT and creativity in a way that will benefit both.

AB  - This paper sheds light on 3–5-year-old children’s enactments of computational empowerment (CE) in activities with computational thinking (CT). CT is widely elaborated on as a universal problem-solving approach and a skill set necessary for thriving in today’s digitized societies. Scholars claim that CT for all should be ensured from an early age, and several studies develop and examine age-appropriate technological tools, as well as pedagogical approaches, for young children’s learning of CT. Based on 1.5 years of co-designing for children’s situated CT in two Danish kindergartens, the present study conducts a socioculturally informed analysis of video-observed interactions between children and educational robots. The findings display how children and robots engage in interactions that transcend children’s mastery of CT in any narrow sense. This is examined as situated enactments of CE; as children’s critical and informed decisions regarding the roles that technologies, in this case educational robots, can play in their institutionally situated social lives. The paper concludes that children’s various enactments of CE deserve scholarly and professional attention, both as an important prerequisite for, and as a necessary limitation to, the implementation of CT in kindergartens.

AB  - Since the end of the 20th century, the digitalization of society, including the educational systems, has been growing exponentially. At the same time, education systems have been evolving towards competency-based assessment. Likewise, at the beginning of this century, the idea of Computational Thinking was resurrected by J. Wing, for solving problems and designing systems using concepts of computer science. Today, we can see how all these questions are taking shape in a new competence, called Computational Thinking, related to others that already exist. In this paper, we have studied the skills of Computational Thinking in university students, focusing on abstraction and its possible relationship with other factors. Results conclude that the students fail in relation to abstraction and in algorithmic thinking. Although the ability of abstraction is not easy to measure, a linear regression analysis has been carried out in order to determine its possible study.

AB  - Teaching computational thinking (CT) has become a priority for educators and policymakers tasked with educating and training students for future jobs which are predicted to be increasingly automated. Recent research on effective instructional interventions for developing computational thinking skills, including algorithmic and critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity, and cooperativity, suggests that teaching and learning CT can improve student academic performance. In fact, the extant literature is quite sanguine about the topic of CT. However, few studies have attempted to establish a relationship between CT skills and academic performance. In the present cross-sectional study, we employ path analysis to model the structural relationship between self-reported CT skills and academic performance of a sample of 81 computer science undergraduates enrolled at a Southwestern American university. We found few direct relationships between CT skills and academic performance. We only find a significant positive relationship between creativity and academic performance and a significant negative relationship between cooperativity and academic performance. Our findings are surprising considering the abundant research promoting computational thinking as a key component of 21st century skills. The findings call for further in-depth analysis of computational thinking and the influence on students’ learning and learning outcomes. We discuss our results with respect to recent educational mandates for including CT and instructional alignment in school curricula. Our findings contribute to the existing discussion by helping to clarify the relationship between CT skills and academic performance in higher education.

AB  - Although studies have shown that computational thinking (CT) can enhance learning processes and outcomes across traditional subjects, they have not shown how teachers might scaffold children's CT processes in a technology-mediated learning context. This exploratory study examined how teacher talk and technologies impacted the CT of three children (6 to 8 years old). Seven videotaped 90-minute sessions of weekly project-based activities yielded 4,842 turns of talk (2,974 by children). Statistical discourse analysis revealed the following results. After a teacher command, the children more often executed a sequence of actions toward a solution but less often demonstrated problem understanding than otherwise. Following a teacher's open question, the children were more likely to offer logically organized ideas. In response to a teacher's rhetorical question, they more often searched for information. These results inform educators regarding when to use each type of teacher talk to scaffold children's CT processes.

AB  - ChatGPT (generative pre-trained transformer) is one of the artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that have started to be used in programming education. However, the effect of using ChatGPT in programming education on learning processes and outcomes is not yet known. This study investigated the effect of programming education using the ChatGPT on students' computational thinking skills, programming self-efficacy, and motivation toward the lesson. The research was conducted on 45 undergraduate students who took a university-level programming course. The research was carried out according to the experimental design with the pretest-posttest control group. Students were randomly divided into experimental (n = 21) and control (n = 24) groups. While the experimental group students benefited from the ChatGPT during the weekly programming practices, the control group students did not use this tool. Research data were obtained through the computational thinking scale, computer programming self-efficacy scale, and learning motivation in computer programming courses scale. Research findings revealed that the experimental group students' computational thinking skills, programming self-efficacy, and motivation for the lesson were significantly higher than the control group students. In line with this result, it can be said that it may be useful to benefit from AI technologies such as ChatGPT in programming trainings. The research findings, it was emphasized how the most effective use of AI support in the lessons could be made, and various suggestions were made for researchers and educators in this regard.

AB  - In this paper, we explore how the theoretical notion of possibility space offers a way to study how children's computational thinking develops as a process. Drawing on embodied notions of cognition, we first examine the literature that supports how children's computational thinking emerges as a possibility space that involves conceptualizing possible actions in a given moment, deciding which action to take by anticipating the results of a possible action, and learning from the actions that they have taken. We then use a grounded approach to analyze the problem-solving process of two 5th-grade children who engaged in an educational robotics activity over two 50-minute class periods. The findings lend support for approaching children's computational thinking as a cycle of action-taking that includes conceptualizing, anticipating, and taking action. The findings also support the pedagogical practice of having children predict the results of a computer program to enhance their computational thinking. Implications for the way that teachers can support children in learning to conceptualize what is possible and take action from it are discussed.

AB  - Predictive learner modelling is crucial for personalized education. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great success in education, their potential in learner modelling via image data is unexplored. This research introduces a novel and interpretable approach for Image-based Learner Modelling (ImageLM) using CNNs and transfer learning to model learners’ performance and accordingly classify their computational thinking solutions. The approach integrates Grad-CAM, enabling it to provide insights into its decision-making process. Findings show that our custom CNN outperforms other models (namely ResNet, VGG, and Inception), with 83% accuracy in predicting solution correctness. More importantly, the ImageLM approach identifies the regions that contribute the most to the predictions, shedding light on learners' computational thinking knowledge and advancing toward trustworthy AI for education. These results underline the potential of utilizing imagery data from learners’ activities during the learning process to predict their performance, especially in challenging environments like programming where traditional feature extraction and learning might struggle.

AB  - The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has led to the proliferation of computational thinking (CT) education. However, research on unplugged activities’ influence in elementary math classrooms is limited, despite some exploring programming's cognitive benefits. This study presents both qualitative and quantitative analyzes stemming from a ten-week quasi-experimental research endeavor, specifically tailored for third-grade students. The research devised a series of unplugged activities, encompassing mathematical games, hands-on construction of mathematical logic boards, and calculating shopping discounts. The overarching objective was to investigate the impact of these unplugged activities on students’ mathematical creativity and CT. Students participating in a mathematics curriculum based on unplugged activities (N = 47) were compared with students participating in a traditional lecture-based mathematics curriculum (N = 46). The results indicated that unplugged activities exhibited significant advantages in fostering students’ CT and mathematical creativity across three dimensions, namely, problem-posing creativity (t = 5.830, p < 0.01), problem-solving creativity (t = 6.633, p < 0.01), and creative self-efficacy (t = 7.554, p < 0.01). Furthermore, the study revealed a relationship between students’ mathematical creativity as a predictor of CT. The results of the quantitative analysis were supported by the teacher's and students’ interview data, and the students felt excited and interested in the unplugged activities, whereas some students using the lecture-based method reported boredom and lack of interactivity. This research offered valuable insights for mathematics and CT education practice, underscoring unplugged activity as an innovative instructional approach that brings forth new possibilities for traditional mathematics teaching, with potential applications in the K-12 curriculum.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has received worldwide attention due to its alignment with developing 21st century skills such as creativity, problem-solving, and digital competence. With the increasing provision of programming tools such as robotic toys and tablet apps in the sector of early childhood education (ECE), many ECE researchers and practitioners tend to link CT to programming. However, children are reluctant to sustain their interests in programming activities, and may be further demotivated by debugging failures. This multi-group quasi-experimental study aimed to evaluate the effects of a story-inspired approach in bridging the gap between programming and CT for preschool children. Building on previous literature suggesting storytelling as a powerful, culturally responsive pedagogy, 5-year-old children (N=108) were involved in nine weeks of CT learning via one of the three conditions: Story-Inspired Robot Programming (SIRP), Story-Inspired Tablet Programming (SITP), and unplugged CT education. Results revealed that children who participated in the SIRP and SITP conditions showed improved CT scores, relative to unplugged CT education, even after controlling for baseline CT scores. No gender or family socioeconomic effects were found to influence the benefits of story-inspired programming interventions. These findings suggest that storytelling as a culturally responsive approach, whether using robots or tablets as a programming tool, can provide young children with more inclusive and sustainable CT learning experiences.

AB  - Content area K-12 teachers are increasingly asked to integrate computing and computational thinking into their classrooms, yet they often have little experience with computing. The purpose of this study was to understand how science teachers, new to computing and integrating computational thinking into their classrooms, supported students as computational problem solvers. In the project from which this research was drawn, 8th grade science teachers in three US school districts integrated computer game design into their study of climate systems and climate change. We conducted participant observation, collected teacher implementation logs and interviewed 15 teachers engaged in the three-year design research project, Building Systems from Scratch. Analysis through grounded theory yielded several results related to teachers’ orientations, strategies, and use of resources to create systems of distributed expertise. We identified five major themes: a) releasing responsibility to students, b) co-learning with students, c) encouraging students’ independent problem solving, d) building interdependence among students, and e) providing multiple other resources. Findings are discussed in relation to the literature on integrating computational thinking into content area classrooms.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is currently used as an umbrella term in education to describe the processes associated with learning and applying computer science concepts and strategies for problem-solving. Despite a growing body of literature on the subject within education and the development of a grand variety of tools designed to enhance computational thinking abilities, the relations between CT and other cognitive abilities have not been reported in young children. Understanding CT from a cognitive development perspective could be useful for creating targeted interventions tailored for young children. In the present study, we compare a previously reported computational thinking assessment with a battery of nine cognitive tests, which include fluid intelligence, working memory, planning, sequencing, mental rotation, vocabulary, and early math precursors such as numerical transcoding and symbolic magnitude comparison. Mixed-effects linear regressions were implemented with CT as a dependent variable to explore the associations between our variables. A subsample of children who participated in an educational robotics intervention were assessed in their robot programming performance, and its outcomes were compared with their CT assessments. Results suggest temporal sequencing ability and symbolic magnitude comparison are significant predictors of CT in kindergarten. Positive significant associations between robot programming and CT performance are reported.

AB  - The research aims to evaluate the effect of a robotics-based computational thinking program on executive functions and visuospatial skills in preschool children. Additionally, the study will explore the relationship between these three variables and early experiences with toys. The study will be a cluster-randomized controlled trial with pre- and post-intervention measures. Participants will be preschool children aged 5 to 6 years from both public and private institutions. The intervention will involve a new educational robotics device called ROVERSA and will consist of eight sessions distributed over four weeks, with the experimental group placed on a waitlist. To assess executive functions and visuospatial skills, standardized and validated neuropsychological measures will be used, including the Flanker task, the NIH Toolbox Card Sorting Test, the Corsi Block Test, the NEPSY-II Mental Rotation Test, the Pyramid of Mexico from the ENI-2 battery, and the Computational Thinking Test (CTt). Data analysis will begin with a hypothesis tested through ANOVA-MR, and linear regressions will be implemented to assess the relationship between variables. It is expected that the results will contribute to the discussion on teaching computational thinking and educational robotics as early learning experiences and their impact on the cognitive development of children.

AB  - Educators emphasize that computational thinking is especially helpful in raising problem-solving skills, improving logical reasoning, and developing analytical thinking. In this context, the aim of this study is to develop an online, interactive, valid, reliable and useful performance-based assessment tool for measuring computational thinking skills. Data were collected in two stages with three different measurement tools. In the data collection phase, a psychometric scale, a skill test and an interactive web application developed in this study were used. In the study in which a total of 203 high school students participated, it was determined that the students' computational thinking skills were at average level. as a result, a valid and reliable performance-based platform was developed for measuring computational thinking skills. It has also been concluded that the performance-based measurement tool makes a better measurement than the psychometric scale. It is emphasized that computational thinking should be treated as a skill or group of skills, not as a theoretical knowledge, product/portfolio or attitude/perception. Therefore, it is believed that developing performance-based tools for evaluating computational thinking skills and measuring them by using multiple measurement tools will give more accurate results. Considering the developments in computational thinking, it is thought that the study will contribute to the literature.

AB  - Computing education has progressively entered into children's early years. Due to a proliferation of computing education programs and coding tools designed for young children, research on the relationships between computational thinking (CT) and other domains of learning and development is highly warranted. Yet, there is little empirical evidence that shows the relationship between CT and children's overall cognitive functioning. As such, this study explored the relationships between Chinese children's CT and their sequencing ability and self-regulation in early childhood. One hundred and one Chinese young children (Ngirl = 52 and Nboy = 49; Mage = 5.25, SD = 0.73) were recruited and evaluated with three reliable instruments. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that: (1) CT positively predicted sequencing ability (β = 0.27, p < .05) even after controlling for relevant demographic covariates such as age, gender, and family socioeconomic status; (2) CT positively predicted self-regulation (β = 0.47, p < .001) after controlling for demographic covariates. Our findings suggest that CT may be a domain-general ability that is based on cognitive foundations that extend beyond the realm of computing.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is regarded as the conceptual basis required for identifying and solving real-world problems through algorithmic approaches to achieve transferable solutions. Developing students' CT in primary school stages is essential and has received considerable attention. Meanwhile, researchers incorporated digital badges into classrooms to improve students' learning motivation in computer science (CS). However, few solid empirical studies analyze the effects of the digital badges approach in CS education to develop students' CT. Therefore, to bridge this gap, this study designed and implemented a block-based programming course in a primary school and examined the impact of the digital badges approach on pupils' CT skills and self-efficacy and learning motivation in CS. A quasi-experimental design was conducted among 99 third-grade students across three classes. The results revealed that the adapted digital badges in primary school (1) significantly improved the students' CT skills, (2) had no significant positive impact on their CT self-efficacy or learning motivation in CS, and (3) showed no mediating effect of learning motivation on the relationship between CT skills and CT self-efficacy. In addition, we found that whether students could see only their own digital badges or also those of others had no impact on CT skills, self-efficacy, or learning motivation in CS. These findings have implications for the design of digital badge educational interventions intended to promote students' CT and learning motivation.

AB  - Computational thinking refers to a series of cognitive processes involved in solving problems through computational systems. A growing body of studies has managed to demonstrate the correlation between computational thinking and different cognitive domains. In recent decades, multiple studies have taken place that seek to evaluate the effect of computational thinking on higher-order cognitive processes. The current study aims to contribute to this discussion by analyzing the effect of an intervention program in computational thinking on the executive functions of school-age children. In this experimental study, 30 children aged 10 and 11 were randomly assigned to an experimental group and an active control group. The instruments to collect the data were 15 tests of the neuropsychological battery of executive functions and frontal lobes BANFE-2, which were applied to both groups before and after the intervention. The experimental group participated in an 8-week computational thinking intervention during which its participants enrolled in plugged and unplugged activities and carried out block programming language twice a week. The results showed that the intervention had significant effects on executive functions associated with the anterior prefrontal cortex and the dorsolateral cortex, but not those related to the orbitofrontal area.

AB  - Learning coding during early childhood is an effective way for children to practice computational thinking. Aspects of children's motivation can increase the likelihood that children approach computational thinking activities with enthusiasm and deep engagement. Gender inequities may interfere with children's readiness to take advantage of opportunities to build computational thinking skills through activities such as coding. Societal stereotypes can reduce young girls’ motivation to engage with computer science, preventing them from gaining benefits from coding activities designed to support computational thinking. This study examined children's gender stereotypes as well as children's own motivation for computer coding in 363 first- through third-grade children. We assessed gender differences in both stereotypes and motivation, as well as links between the stereotypes that individual children held and their own motivation. Children generally endorsed stereotypes about interest and ability for computer coding that favored their own-gender group, although third-grade girls reported gender-egalitarian beliefs about interest in coding. There were no gender differences in children's motivation for computer coding in terms of their own interest, sense of belonging, or ability self-concepts. Children's stereotypes about their own-gender group were significantly positively correlated with their own motivation for computer coding. These findings suggest that early childhood represents an excellent age for children to begin building computational thinking skills, before girls endorse negative stereotypes about their gender's interest in computer science.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is an essential skill students need if they are to adapt to the rise of digital society, and the evaluation of CT is crucial for enhancing students’ CT. However, the current evaluation of CT is based on a summative paradigm and ignores real CT performance during the assessment process. This study thus used a multimodal cognitive diagnostic model (H-MCDM) of students’ CT based on multimodal data in situational tasks, to achieve precise evaluation and explore the current mastery status of students’ CT and their cognitive and behavioral characteristics. The research results indicate that: 1) students’ CT was at a moderately high level and indicated a good grasp of the CT components of problem decomposition and algorithm design, but students had not yet mastered problem abstraction, 2) a total of six different CT latent patterns were discerned in the overall student results, 3) individual students who shared the same CT latent patterns could differ in their cognitive and behavioral characteristics, while those with different CT latent patterns could share similar characteristics. This study showed that it is possible to capture the degree of students’ mastery of CT and their cognitive and behavioral differences with the same or different CT latent patterns at a granular level, providing a basis for developing individualized strategies to enhance students’ CT.

AB  - In-service elementary school teachers need training to teach computational thinking (CT). A common model for CT professional learning programs includes an initial workshop followed by ongoing support. However, little research has examined the efficacy of ongoing support, the most effective types, and its impact on classroom practices. The current study details a multifaceted CT professional learning program with innovative ongoing support to help elementary school teachers implement the Code.org curriculum. It also empirically investigated the impact of the support on teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT, the effectiveness of each component of the support, and to what extent it affected teachers' classroom practices. Our ongoing support included an additional workshop, grade-level professional learning community (PLC) sessions, instructional videos, and teacher leaders' support. Data included a pre-survey, four post-surveys, lesson observations, a focus group interview, tracking the number of video views, and surveys from PLC participants and teacher leaders. Results indicated that the ongoing support significantly increased teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT. Regarding the effectiveness of the various components of the ongoing support, the additional workshop significantly increased teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT. Teachers valued each component of the support, and this support improved teachers’ classroom practices.

AB  - The present study investigates the debugging process of 526 children in preschool (4–6 aged) when programming a tangible robot. When a child is involved in programming, it is needed to identify and correct errors, or in other words, debug a program. Debugging is a high-level thinking skill and is an essential component closely related to developing Computational Thinking in early childhood education. Though the debugging process is a cognitive function in programming investigated by many researchers in recent decades, most studies are conducted either in primary, secondary education, or higher education concerning beginners or experts in programming. Very few reviews, and some focus on preschool education. Our study set out the following objectives: 1) How do children identify the existence of error and locate it? 2) What types of errors emerge when coding? 3) What type of error is complex for novice programmers? 4) What strategies are developed by novice programmers to debug effectively? and 5) What types of knowledge do novice programmers construct by debugging the tangible robot Bee-Bot? The study follows an iterative model of a design-based research approach. It uses multiple case studies to collect qualitative and quantitative data. The programming intervention was implemented by 30 educators in their classrooms and was based on a scenario-based teaching design. The debugging process was analysed using Klahr & Craven's framework (1988): 1) test and evaluate program, 2) identify bug, 3) represent program, 4) locate bug and 5) correct bug. The main finding is the construction and development of syntactic and semantic knowledge.

AB  - A plethora of programming platforms purports to teach preschool-aged children computational thinking (CT) and coding skills. However, the empirical evidence to support their effectiveness is still in its early stages. A three-week didactic intervention using ScratchJr was conducted to investigate its effectiveness in fostering CT and rudimentary coding skills in a cohort of preschool children (N = 34, aged 4–6 years). While the initial performance mean of the control group (M = 7.07, SD = 2.58) exhibits a statistically significant elevation t (22.64 = 2.23, p = 0.036) vis-à-vis the experimental group (M = 5.35, SD = 1.58), t (22.64) = 2.23, p = 0.0 the terminal performance means of both groups converge closely. However, meticulous data analysis unveils a statistically notable enhancement among preschool participants exposed to the educational intervention involving ScratchJr. Notably, both instructional modalities appear commensurate in nurturing elementary computational tenets, namely modularity and control structures. The experimental cohort outperforms the control group with statistical significance in comprehending potent ideational constructs encompassing representation, algorithms, and hardware/software interplay. Conversely, the control group performs better in grasping the debugging concept than their experimental counterparts. The outcomes lend substantive credence to the efficacy of the distinct programming milieu offered by ScratchJr, underscoring its effectiveness in cultivating CT and coding proficiencies within the preschool demographic.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is crucial for students. Robot-supported learning has emerged as a popular approach for CT cultivation. To understand the effects of robot-supported CT cultivation, the current study conducted a meta-analysis to analyze studies from Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Science Direct databases (2012–2022) which screened using keywords ``computational thinking'' and ``robot''. After further screening, 26 peer-reviewed articles were selected. We synthesized the 33 effect sizes to assess the overall effectiveness of robot-supported learning on CT and its sub-dimensions: concepts, practices, and perspectives. Our findings revealed a medium effect of robot-supported learning on students' CT (g = 0.643), a large effect on CT concepts (g = 0.650), a medium effect on CT practices (g = 0.587), and a huge effect on CT perspectives (g = 1.419). We also explored the moderators (i.e., grade level, study duration, culture, learning strategy, and assessment tool) that might influence the effects of robot-supported CT cultivation. Moderator analyses indicated that short-term (less than four weeks) robot-supported learning had a larger effect (g = 0.901) on CT practice than long-term (more than eleven weeks) learning (g = 0.309). This meta-analysis indicates that educators could apply robot-supported learning to cultivate students' CT and concludes with related implications.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has gained increasing recognition as a 21st-century competency. Although initiatives have been taken to define the term for educational practices, limited empirical evidence is available to clarify its underlying components, especially at the primary education level. This study aimed to identify the associations between CT and specific cognitive skills in the primary school context. Based on the literature, three cognitive domains were studied (i.e., mathematical, visuospatial, and reasoning skills) and standard test batteries were applied to a sample of 633 primary students (aged 7–12 years). Linear regression analyses were performed with CT performance as the dependent variable to investigate its associations with the measured cognitive skills, and demographic features (i.e., age, gender) and coding learning experience (i.e., years of coding experience, extra-curricular coding experience) were included as control variables. The results indicated that the students’ CT performance was significantly predicted by their attainments in numeracy, visual perception, spatial visualisation, and inductive reasoning, and the results remained significant after controlling for demographics and coding experience. The study adds to the literature by enriching the understanding of CT as a psychological construct and has practical implications for educational stakeholders regarding the importance of interdisciplinary teaching and the integration of specific cognitive skills into CT learning activities.

AB  - The sustainable and digital future of work may imply a dramatic equilibrium change between social factors and technological ones. We argue that providing suitable tools to support End-User Development (EUD) in the workplace could represent a way to cope with such future changes. The contributions of this paper include the analysis and characterization of the most used EUD techniques and their crossover with a new conveyed model of Computational Thinking. The synthesis between these aspects is made explicit in the construct of EUDability, which is designed to capture the quality dimensions of EUD systems suitable to work scenarios where better roles and better tools for individuals may be shaped. EUDability has to do with identifying and assessing the difficulties of EUD techniques on one side and the Computational Thinking skills held by individuals on the other side.

AB  - There has been an increasing interest in the integration of technology into language education. Meanwhile, computational thinking (CT) skills are fostered which influence communicative language teaching and learning. Despite CT's established importance in science education, its significance in language teaching remains scarce. This study contributes to knowledge synthesis and methodological development by reviewing 16 journal articles, analyzing CT applications in language learning across educational contexts, intervention tools, CT skills, language acquisition, and assessment methods. The results indicate that (a) more CT-involved activities are needed for primary, secondary, and tertiary education, (b) educational robots and Scratch stand out as the most trending intervention tools, (c) CT skills such as decomposition, abstraction, generalization and so on have a positive effect on students’ foreign language acquisition, especially in grammar and writing, (d) assessment of CT development can be surveyed through a validated and reliable instrument such as computer programming self-efficacy scale or an online platform: Dr. Scratch; Conversely, there is a diversity of evaluation tools in foreign language learning. This study is the first to review experimental research on integrating computational thinking into foreign language learning and offers significant implications for future research.

AB  - The development of programming skills and computational thinking in the formal educational context is one of the most recent horizons set by many educational systems worldwide. Although the first computational thinking initiatives are being applied from the earliest school ages, this research focuses on the secondary education level. Specifically, the objective is the following: to analyse the implementation of Arduino, as well as the benefits and opportunities it brings to secondary school students. For this purpose, documentary research has been undertaken applying a systematic review according to the PRISMA 2020 framework following the PiCoS strategy. Atlas.ti 9 was used to analyse the information. Out of 316 papers identified, 37 were included in the research. In relation to the results, Arduino is primarily used in technology and physics subjects, although it is also used to develop interdisciplinary STEAM projects. As a rule, it is used to learn programming languages, but likewise as a resource to develop science experiments. LED lights, servomotors and breadboards are among the most commonly used resources together with the Arduino board. and Scratch was the most widely used software. The initiatives implemented have yielded both positive and negative results, for example, one drawback is that some projects are very difficult, and some achievements such as: increased motivation towards the contents addressed or also the development of some soft skills, such as problem solving.

AB  - Recently, virtual reality (VR) technology has shown great potential in advancing education with many pedagogical benefits for building the 21st-century teaching and learning experience. This study conducted a formative evaluation of an immersive VR expedition application with the aim of understanding users' learning processes and how the application facilitates higher education students' computational thinking skills. Six participants were randomly selected to conduct this evaluation. A mixed research approach consisting of quantitative and qualitative methods was employed. The study quantitatively analyzed users' scores from gameplay to understand how the intervention supported computational thinking skills. Participants were also interviewed to collect data after playing the mini-games to investigate users' experiences. The study showcases players' computational thinking competency, assessed automatically during gameplay. Further, this study used inductive content analysis to demonstrate users' reactions to prototyped VR mini-games. The qualitative findings suggest that users found the VR mini-games interactive and immersive, which provided an opportunity to foster learners' computational thinking skills. The quantitative analysis revealed that student's computational thinking competency can be enhanced through consistent playing of the mini-games. Moreover, the expedition aspect of the VR game stimulated learners' curiosity, which sustained their learning progress. Furthermore, users gained new knowledge and found the mini-games educative. Nevertheless, several aspects of the VR mini-games need improvements, according to users' perceptions. This study contributes to the knowledge in terms of the affordances of VR in education research and provides relevant insights that can shape future studies, for example, the recent hype of metaverse in education.

AB  - Project-Based Learning (PBL) and Computational Thinking (CT), a teaching strategy and a problem-solving method, respectively, have been widely used in teaching and learning because of their educational advantages for students and teachers. However, studies of their integration into the teaching and learning process have been scarce, resulting in a lack of guidance for educators to implement such an approach that apply constructivism learning theory. This study aims to systematically review and identify appropriate frameworks, models, techniques and tools that could guide the successful implementation of PBL-CT. This study examined relevant articles published from 2017 to 2021 to highlight the gaps in the PBL-CT execution and map their backgrounds into a coherent taxonomy that could help guide the directions of future studies. As revealed, none of such articles explicitly explain any suitable PBL-CT frameworks or models. The study identified several common elements for the PBL-CT framework formulation, indicating scaffolding and inquiry are the most commonly applied techniques, with visual tools dominating the PBL-CT implementation. Most articles involved computing, followed by STEM, with a few originating from non-STEM fields. Several important implications could help educators develop an effective PBL-CT course design and provide some guidelines for future research. An effective PBL-CT integration enhances teaching and learning besides improving students' computational thinking skills. Thinking skills are critical 21st-century skills needed for students' success.

AB  - Computational thinking has become an integral component of curricula worldwide, necessitating teachers to develop this competence in their students. To effectively meet these curricular requirements, teachers themselves need a solid foundation of computational thinking content knowledge, which refers to the understanding and skills they possess in this area. However, despite widespread recognition of this need, few studies have rigorously examined teachers' content knowledge in this domain. Addressing this gap requires the development of high-quality measurement tools. This study details the development of an instrument, created as part of the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) 2023 in Flanders, to measure lower secondary school teachers' computational thinking content knowledge in a valid and reliable way. The article first outlines the construction process of the instrument, which involved close collaboration with experts in the field and drew upon the framework of Fraillon et al. (2023). Following this, the instrument's psychometric properties are presented, which include both item-level and overall instrument characteristics. These properties were evaluated using data from a sample of 352 participants, applying both Classical Test Theory and Item Response Theory. The final tool consists of sixteen multiple-choice and short constructed response questions. The results indicate favorable item and overall instrument characteristics, thereby affirming its potential to measure the intended construct in a valid and accurate way.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) skills help students both understand and utilize computing in various domains to cope with the challenges posed by the complex digital world. This study applied mind mapping to programming language instruction in a primary school, and explored the effects of mind mapping on students' CT skills when learning programming with Scratch as a programming tool. Two types of mind mapping, construct-by-self mind mapping (CBS-MM) and construct-on-scaffold mind mapping (COS-MM), were proposed to compare which type is more effective in terms of students' CT skills. Seventy-three public primary school fifth-grade students aged 10 to 11 participated in the study. The CBS group included 33 students learning with the CBS-MM instructional approach, while the COS group comprised 40 students learning with the COS-MM instructional approach. Data were obtained from nine topic Scratch programming assignments and pre- and post-CT skills surveys completed by the two groups. Paired sample t tests were used to analyze whether the two types of mind mapping approach could improve both groups' CT skills. One-way ANCOVA and one-way ANOVA were used to examine the difference in the two groups' CT skills. The results showed that both CBS-MM and COS-MM can improve students' CT skills; however, the COS group students could better improve their CT skills with the assistance of the COS-MM method compared with the CBS group students who learned with the CBS-MM method. The findings of this study can provide some enlightenment for relevant instructors to design instruction and implement programming teaching with different kinds of mind mapping support that facilitates students’ CT.

AB  - The specific mechanisms by which teachers and parents can provide culturally relevant opportunities for computational thinking for racially/ethnically and linguistically diverse groups of preschoolers remain unknown. Accordingly, the purpose of this research is to examine how PreK parent and teacher voice directed efforts to realize a culturally relevant computing program. We drew data sources from a subsample of design-based research meetings in which partners collaborated to co-develop the first iteration of the program. Using qualitative analysis, we examined how parent voice and teacher voice, conceptualized as perspectives and participation, influenced theories of culturally responsive computing and computational thinking in early childhood education and the translation of theory into practice in classroom and home settings. Findings showed that connecting powerful ideas from computational thinking, namely algorithms and problem solving (e.g., debugging), to familiar activities and experiences served as a powerful entry point. Yet, differences arose in how teachers and parents conceptualized culturally relevant computing and made connections to familiar routines. We discuss what can be learned from parent voice in regards to bolstering children's self-expression, access to increasingly complex computational thinking tasks, and opportunities for learning cultural and community values through computing.

AB  - In recent years, the development of computational thinking (CT) has become integral to many school curricula worldwide. This has been associated with calls for computational thinking to be considered a ‘21St Century’ competency, valuable to all students as a transferable process for solving problems and building understanding of human behaviour and systems. However, while computational thinking is a focus of most secondary school computer science curricula, proponents such as Jeanette Wing argue its relevance for younger students, indicating more work must be done investigating its development in early years' education. This study used a structured, problem-based curriculum supported by guided inquiry pedagogy, to explore 6 year old students' learning of basic computational thinking concepts and practices while coding programmable floor robots (Blue-bots and an iPad app). Results indicated improvement across the seven lessons in students' sequencing/algorithm authoring, error correction, and pattern recognition. Furthermore, they revealed evidence of higher order thinking such as identifying patterns in code, and how these can be transferred to help solve problems of different designs. While currently play-based approaches are used to introduce computational thinking concepts and practices in early years' education, results from this study suggest that more structured, problem-based methods should be seriously considered. Results challenge commonly understood developmental theories about what young children can and can't do, contextualised within the field of computer science, and hold implications for early years' teachers' professional knowledge and pedagogy if they are to promote their students' learning in this increasingly important area. Given rapid technological advancements such as artificial intelligence (AI) and increasingly earlier exposure of young children to digitally-mediated information, this study provides support for the earlier and more systematic introduction of basic digital literacy knowledge and skills in early years' education.

AB  - We conducted a systematic review of empirical studies aimed at exploring robot-mediated activities to promote the development of computational thinking in preschoolers. In this study, we investigated the robots used, proposed activities, and evaluation processes. We also analyzed research contexts and the stated motivations to conduct the studies. Our review identified characteristics of the robots, such as input and output interfaces, cost, and availability. We also categorized activities considering context, modality of work, type of activities, duration, adults’ role, scaffolding, unplugged activities, explicit debugging, communication and sharing instances, and teaching knowledge from other domains. We analyzed the computational thinking evaluation process looking at types of assessments, asset concepts, and research design. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of existing research, identifies existing gaps, and provides recommendations for future studies.

AB  - The integration of computational thinking (CT) into K-12 education offers substantial potential to improve digital literacy and deepen students’ understanding across various subject areas. By embedding computational procedures and solution-oriented approaches into traditional curricula, students can develop essential skills that are critical for thriving in an increasingly digital world. However, the effective integration of CT into subject-specific learning poses challenges for educators, largely due to a lack of training and experience in implementing interdisciplinary instructional strategies. This study explores the impact of integrating CT into K-12 education through diverse instructional approaches, including modelling, storytelling, and unplugged activities. The research examines how students' subject knowledge, CT concepts, and practices evolved under each CT integration practice, as well as their acceptance toward CT integrated lessons. The study was conducted in different subjects, including language arts, biology, and physics, and at different grade levels. The technology acceptance model was used as a theoretical framework to understand students' adoption towards the different integration practices. The study revealed that different CT integration practices yield varying impacts on students' attitudes, particularly in relation to their prior programming experiences. Namely, primary school students with prior programming experience display a higher behavioural intention due to a lack of early biases toward programming. Conversely, secondary school students, less familiar with interdisciplinary approaches, initially show less enthusiasm for future engagement. These insights underscore the need for tailored instructional strategies that consider students' prior experiences and the broader goal of preparing them to contribute to a technologically driven society.

AB  - As we begin to identify essential skills for the future, there has been an increased focus on how to define and implement computational thinking within education. However, the question of how to engage children with coding activities within the context and limitations of the curriculum remains relatively explored. In our study, a human-centered design approach was followed to guide a small group of children through the co-design, implementation and evaluation of a board game. The board game had two versions: an offline version involving a robotic agent and an online version with its digital equivalent. A mixed-method approach was used to understand and compare levels of engagement, usability, and collaboration in both versions of the game. The tangible aspect of working with a robotic agent in the offline version led to greater levels of motivation and involvement with the game mechanics. Tangible robotics games tend to be more approachable for children. Our study shows that using such games by connecting the mathematics curriculum with coding problems can successfully engage participants in collaborative computational thinking activities. We contribute to the field by providing human-centered guidance for the creation of educational tools to develop computational thinking. Such guidance is not only applicable in technologically rich environments; it can also be applied in educational communities with limited access to technology.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has been relevant in teaching STEM courses, and educators are incorporating both plugged and unplugged CT activities in their modules to prepare new entrants for advanced knowledge. However, additional empirical data are needed to understand how an unplugged activities approach can lead to an improved understanding of CT concepts. Therefore, this study investigates the impact of unplugged activities on novice students' CT skills and unravels the characteristics of students' CT competency from performing unplugged activities. The experimental aspect of this study was conducted with a cohort of 210 students participating in an introductory programming course at a University in Nigeria. A mixed-method research approach and a quasi-experimental design were applied in this study to understand how the unplugged approach in teaching CT could help students improve their CT competency. A paired-sample t-test of familiarity score for each CT concept showed a significant increase in the score before and after the intervention. Furthermore, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was used for topic modeling of the text describing students’ solutions. Topic modeling allows for more insights into the steps taken by the students to solve CT problems. Only 27.62 % of students' solution descriptions contained CT concepts, 56.90 % of the students solved the puzzle with an optimal score, and 72.41 % of students who applied CT concepts of problem abstraction and decomposition were able to solve the puzzle correctly. Indeed, CT unplugged activities significantly increased the number of students who gained CT competency. In addition, this study provides recommendation for computer science educators and highlight future direction.

AB  - Computational thinking is a fundamental competence that is being introduced in K-12 and succeeding curricula worldwide. Despite this huge effort, many computational thinking models in the literature do not explicitly take into consideration the pupils’ age and the developmental nature of computational thinking skills. Furthermore, many existing computational thinking models are focused on the internal thinking processes of the individuals, failing to explicitly consider the situated nature, in terms of social context and artefactual environment, that usually characterise tasks that require computational thinking to be solved. In this paper, we present a framework for the design, realisation, analysis, and assessment of computational thinking activities, called CT-cube. The CT-cube allows to extend existing computational thinking models to consider the life-long development of computational thinking skills in individuals, from childhood to adult age, and to take into consideration the situated nature of computational thinking activities. We use the CT-cube to design an unplugged task, called Cross Array Task (CAT), allowing to assess the algorithmic skills of K-12 pupils and we show how the CT-cube can be used in this case to illustrate the development of this competence along the entire compulsory school path, considering a sample of 109 pupil aged 3 to 16 in Switzerland.

AB  - The current single teaching and assessing modes of English as a foreign language (EFL) grammar in China have caused the disconnect between grammar knowledge and competency with numerous errors in essay writing, somehow ignoring the analysis of learners thinking patterns. To solve the problem, computational thinking (CT), a higher-order thinking in solving problems and optimizing the way to acquire knowledge, was employed in the study. As needed, the experimental group was taught using the CT teaching model following CT principal elements (data analysis, pattern recognition, abstraction, decomposition, and parallelization), while the control group followed the traditional teaching mode. Quantitative and qualitative data were obtained based on the pre-test-post-test, classroom observation, and questionnaire survey. The results show that the grammar application in short essay writing of all the members of the experimental group significantly improved and that higher grammar learning agency and engagement were unfolded to show the changes of thinking patterns. However, not all the members from the control group showed similar results. CT serves as an important social mediation tool in EFL teaching. This study further enriches the teaching modes of grammar and is an effective attempt at introducing CT into learners’ thinking patterns.

AB  - With growing interest in supporting the development of computational thinking (CT) in early childhood, there is also need for new assessments that serve multiple purposes and uses. In particular, there is a need to understand the design of formative assessments that can be used during classroom instruction to provide feedback to teachers and children in real-time. In this paper, we report on an empirical study and advance a new unit of observational analysis for formative assessment that we call an indicator of a knowledge refinement opportunity or as a shorthand, KRO indicators. We put forth a new framework for conceptualizing the design of formative assessments that builds on the Evidence Centered Design framework but centers identification and analysis of indicators of knowledge refinement opportunities. We illustrate a number of key indicators through empirical examples drawn from video recordings of Kindergarten classroom lessons.

AB  - Interest in coding education has exploded in the past five years, especially in elementary and early secondary education. Teachers who are largely new to coding are expected to guide entire student bodies through the fundamentals of coding and computational thinking. But little is known about which coding and computational thinking (CT) concepts teachers feel most comfortable with and which concepts they struggle with. This study describes 127 elementary coding teachers’ changes in their beliefs about teaching coding and CT as they participated in year-long continuous professional development. Novice elementary coding teachers demonstrated most growth in their self-efficacy for teaching sequences, algorithms and loops. They were less secure in their knowledge of conditionals, variables, and functions. For computational thinking, teachers were most confident in their ability to identify patterns, think algorithmically, understand logic, and evaluate outcomes, showing less growth with decomposition and abstraction.

AB  - This study compares the effects of coding education with educational robot and unplugged coding activities on pre-school students' computational thinking and executive function skills. This study used a pre-test and post-test comparison group quasi-experimental design. The study was conducted in a public kindergarten with 48 pre-school students (24 educational robot- BeeBot® group and 24-unplugged coding group) aged 5-6. The TechCheck-K test was used to measure computational thinking skills, and Executive Functions Battery-Computerized Touch was used to measure executive function skills. The process started with pre-test applications and ended with post-tests after four weeks (16 different sessions) of the implementation in both groups. The study found a statistically significant difference between the computational thinking pre-test and post-test scores of pre-school students in both groups in favor of the post-test. It was determined that there was a statistically significant difference in favor of the educational robot group between the post-test scores of computational thinking skills. In addition, when the findings regarding executive functions were evaluated, there was a statistically significant difference between the pre-test and post-test scores of total executive function in favor of the post-test in both groups. However, it was observed that there was no statistically significant difference between the post-test scores of both groups in terms of total executive function skills scores. In addition, when the post-test scores of pre-school students in two groups were evaluated, it was determined that there was no significant difference in computational thinking and executive function skills according to gender. Consequently, it was determined that coding education with an educational robot was more effective for gaining computational thinking skills than unplugged coding activities for pre-school students. However, it was observed that there was no difference between the two groups in terms of the development of executive function skills in pre-school education.

AB  - Since environmental and energy issues and challenges continues to emerge as key global concerns, Green Building Certification Systems are becoming increasingly relevant in the construction industry. In this regard, LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is considered one of the most widely recognized environmental assessment methods used globally in the construction industry today. However, due to the high level of complexity of the LEED system, the tools usually used to verify the achievement of the credits lack of “design friendliness” and hardly communicate effectively with the conventional tools used by architects and engineers (e.g. CAD, BIM). This makes difficult to fully take into account, especially at the early design stage, the many interconnected aspects that contribute to the green certification, with consequent issues often arising in the design validation and/or construction phases, resulting in time delays and cost increments. The application of innovative problem-solving methods, such as computational thinking, together with coding techniques, represents an effective way to deal with this issue. This kind of methodology, in fact, allows the requirements of a specific LEED credit to be digitally parametrised and flexibly incorporated into a “designer friendly” working environment. In particular, Visual Programming Languages (VPLs), due to their high simplicity of usage, allow architects and engineers to develop algorithms and thus implement their technical knowledge in the field of environmental design with computer programming skills, useful to improve their tools and keep them constantly updated. The aim of this paper is to illustrate a methodology through which, by merging computational thinking strategies with VPL tools, is possible to keep under control, in the same working environment, all the parameters required to verify in real time the achievement of LEED credits. To demonstrate the flexibility of the approach, dedicated tools developed for the verification of some specific credits at different scales – neighbourhood and building – are illustrated as operational examples of the proposed methodology.

AB  - Computational thinking, defined by Wing (2011) as the “thought processes involved in formulating problems … so that the solutions are represented in a form that can effectively be carried out by an information-processing agent,” has become the central construct of K12 computing education around the world. This article provides a history of computational thinking, a summary of computational thinking's role in educational policy and practice, role as a research construct, and concludes by considering the future of computational thinking. The debate over how to define and teach computational thinking can be understood as a proxy for the broader questions about education.

AB  - Collecting and organizing data to understand and answer real-world questions is an increasingly important skill in our current world. Fostering data collection and analysis (DCA) skills in young children leverages key mathematics skills as well as the data representation, visualization, and interpretation skills of computational thinking (CT), culminating in a problem-solving approach with data. As such, the intervention, comprising investigations and a digital app, supported preschool teachers and children to answer data-focused questions by engaging in each step of the DCA process in order to foster CT and math skills. Teachers appreciated that the app offers a new way for children to visualize data and noted that the app provided learning opportunities for children that would not otherwise be possible or easy to implement. Results also suggest that the app provides a systematic process for data collection, entry, and interpretation. Children in classrooms that completed the intervention had significantly higher scores at post-intervention compared to children in classrooms that did not complete the intervention, controlling for pre-intervention scores, B(SE) = 0.13(0.05), t (6) = 2.48, p = .048.

AB  - Computational Thinking (CT), the conceptual foundations required for solving complex problems effectively and efficiently, is an imperative skill for today's learners, across disciplines and across ages. As for its importance in the wide network of digital literacies, CT has been implemented in various educational contexts, however mostly via digital artifacts, specifically in programming-related activities. This approach does not fulfill the potential of such integration for promoting learning. In this paper, we argue that digital literacies should not be bound to the digital realm, and present a novel approach to fully integrate CT into learning and teaching by the development of CT-infused “unplugged” pedagogical tools that are fully embedded in the subject matter. We demonstrate the advantages to student learning of these tools in two case studies from K-12 mathematics education: 1) An assistive tool for function investigation in high-school calculus – in this case, we point out to how CT skills that were implemented in the tool promoted students' problem solving; 2) A teaching unit for pattern sequences in elementary school – in this case, we show how students in the CT research group outperformed students in the other groups, and how they implemented CT to solve pattern sequence problems effectively and efficiently. We highlight that besides enhancing learning, this approach can help address the important issue of equity in education, and suggest ways to promote it via dedicated professional development.

AB  - Creativity and Computational Thinking (CT) have been pointed out as two important skills that would promote students in the digital age as contributing members of society. Therefore, these two constructs have been extensively researched in recent years, but the associations between them are yet to be fully understood. This study takes another step towards bridging this gap by examining the association between CT and three types of creativity, i.e., Figural Creative Thinking, Verbal Creative Thinking, and Computational Creativity. Data was collected from 119 ninth-grade students (14–15 years old) from Israel. Students took two commonly used creativity tests (Torrance's Test of Creative Thinking, and the Alternative Uses Test). They also used Kodetu—an online learning environment for CT—and we used the system log files to measure their CT acquirement and their computational creativity. Findings suggest some nuanced associations between the four sets of variables. Specifically, we point out the limited associations between verbal and figural creativities, some of which are negative; also, we found that the associations between creative thinking and CT, as well as between creative thinking and computational creativity, differ by gender.

AB  - Many studies have demonstrated that Virtual Exchange (VE) for teaching languages can have a positive effect on learners' intercultural awareness or achievements. However, during this century, the teaching process has shifted from teaching with technology to solving problems with it. In this regard, pedagogical experts in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) have developed programming and robotics based on Computational Thinking skills (CTs), which have been regarded as the core of 21st-century skills. In the field of CALL, this skill has received very little attention. Accordingly, we have attempted to switch the process and outcome of language learning in VE. Thus, we developed the conceptual framework that integrated CTsCALL and Individual-technology-task-environment Fit (ITTEF). Having designed our VE tasks based on CTsCALL, we provided the opportunity for 92 Spanish language learners in our project to exchange language and culture with Cypriot and Irish students and solve VE tasks based on CTsCALL. The result of the symmetric phase of the study validated the five-dimensional structure of CTsCALL and the four-dimensional structures of ITTEF in VE and CALL. It also revealed that language learners, who focused on the key information rather than the details while solving language tasks, as well as recognizing the pattern of task solving and applying them to other tasks, found VE, and CTsCALL to be aligned with their current capabilities, learning environment, and problem-solving skills that mediated their intention to learn and exchange information in this context in the future. Furthermore, the asymmetrical part of the study revealed that sixteen solutions are available to shape language learners' continued intention to use VE by combining the components of CTsCALL and ITTEF. Thus, the study developed the CTsCALL questionnaire and its theory into CALL together with the Council of Europe's Common European Framework of Reference for Languages and recommended that CALL researchers and educators take a broader view of VE, as well as continuing to validate CTsCALL in other CALL disciplines to show that this skill belongs to CALL as well.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is gaining increasing attention from researchers and practitioners all over the world to empower children in the digital era. However, there is no consensus on which components of CT to teach beginning coders in early childhood education (ECE). To address this issue, we conducted a systematic review of 42 empirical studies focused on teaching and assessing CT in ECE. We analyzed the included studies with the three-dimensional CT framework proposed by Brennan and Resnick (2012) and demonstrated how this framework could be modified to fit the context of ECE. Based on this systematic review, we sorted out the CT components that were proven suitable for young children to learn by incorporating emerging components and removing components inappropriate for young children. We thus proposed a CT curriculum framework for ECE that covers CT concepts (i.e., control flow/structures, representation, and hardware/software), CT practices (i.e., algorithmic design, pattern recognition, abstraction, debugging, decomposition, iteration, and generalizing), and CT perspectives (i.e., expressing and creating, connecting, perseverance, and choices of conduct). This systematic review and its associated CT curriculum framework provide important theoretical contributions and practical implications for early childhood CT education.

AB  - In this paper, we review and meta-analyze the findings of experimental studies published between 2006 and 2022 that examined the effects of coding and programming interventions on children's core and higher order executive functions (response inhibition, working memory, cognitive flexibility, planning and problem solving). The systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to address three research questions: 1) Which executive functions are most impacted by the teaching of CT? 2) Which instructional modality (educational robotics/virtual coding/unplugged coding) is most effective in enhancing executive function skills in learners aged 4–16 years? and 3) Does the cognitive effectiveness of coding vary with children's age? A total of 19 studies with 1523 participants met the selection criteria for the systematic review. The meta-analysis included 11 of those studies. The results reveal beneficial effects of structured virtual and tangible coding (educational robotics) activities for preschoolers and first graders, and significant effects of more unstructured virtual coding activities (e.g., Scratch-based) for older students. A multivariate fixed-effects model meta-analysis shows that the teaching of coding significantly improves problem-solving with the highest effect (dppc2 = 0.89), but also planning (dppc2 = 0.36), and inhibition and working memory with lower effects (dppc2 = 0.17, dppc2 = 0.20).

AB  - In light of the increasing importance digital economy, the significance of computational thinking has grown exponentially, becoming imperative in both workplace and academic settings such as universities. This article addresses the critical need to comprehend the factors influencing the acceptance of computational thinking. The dataset introduces an extensive questionnaire comprising five constructs and 25 items, rooted in the extended Technology Acceptance Model. Notably, the model incorporates facilitating conditions and subjective norm, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding acceptance. Data collection involved 132 undergraduate university students sampled through purposive sampling, specifically targeting courses with a focus on computational thinking. The resulting dataset serves as a valuable resource for future research, offering detailed insights into the factors determining the acceptance of technology in educational contexts beyond mere thinking skills. Given the scarcity of research on technology acceptance in developing nations, this dataset holds particular significance, serving as a foundation for potential cross-cultural comparisons. The dataset contributes to the field by presenting a robust acceptance model, explaining 74.2 per cent of the variance in behavioural intention, 60.2 per cent in perceived usefulness, and 56.1 per cent in perceived ease of use. This high explanatory power positions the dataset as a superior resource for replication, benchmarking, and broader applicability in diverse contexts, thereby enhancing the understanding of computational thinking acceptance across different populations and settings. This dataset stands among the pioneering efforts to assess the novel covariance-based structural equation model algorithm within SmartPLS 4, presenting a valuable resource for future research employing the same mechanism.

AB  - This paper describes a study designed to investigate the promise of resources that support the development of computational thinking (CT) in preschool children. This study was the culmination of a collaborative research process between researchers and media developers of a home-based intervention that included media and hands-on activities created to support the development of young children's CT. The mixed-methods study included 108 families, each with a 4- or 5-year-old child. Families, who participated in the study at home for six weeks, were randomly assigned to an intervention group that viewed media and engaged with hands-on activities with a CT focus or a control group that viewed and engaged with non-STEM literacy content. Data collection consisted of parent surveys, parent interviews, and CT learning and pre-coding tasks to assess children's CT abilities. Results indicate that the learning intervention demonstrates promise in supporting parental understanding of CT. Experience with the intervention over the six weeks also appeared to cultivate some CT strategy use in children as evidenced by parental reports and performance on learning and pre-coding sequencing tasks.

AB  - This study characterizes the literature on teaching computational thinking (CT) to preschoolers aged 4 to 5 years. Previous research and published systematic studies have provided important contributions about CT teaching to elementary and high school children. However, to date, there is no systematic overview of CT education for preschoolers. For this reason, this systematic mapping synthesizes 82 studies on CT teaching, through the implementation and evaluation of tools and activities to teach, improve or measure the CT knowledge acquired by children. Furthermore, studies on courses or training offered to preschool teachers related to the teaching of CT were also considered. From the selected studies, the following information was collected: year of publication; recovery sources and databases; vehicles and places of publication; temporal delimitation of research, research approach, nature and research method; CT teaching approaches; tools used to teach CT and how they are classified according to their physical characteristics and, finally, participants and individuals responsible for the research. The results suggest an increase in the number of publications in recent years, revealing the interest of researchers in the topic. Furthermore, we observed a trend towards the use of physical artifacts and the use of the disconnected computing approach to teaching CT skills to preschool children. The results also exposed that preschool teachers have little autonomy in implementing CT teaching activities because those are mostly implemented by computer professionals (researchers, teachers, etc.). This is because preschool teachers are still discouraged from teaching computer and technology-related content to children, considering them complex and disconnected from basic curricula. However, when teachers are trained to teach CT, they become interested in the content and become more active during the teaching process. We argue for integrating CT-related content into education curricula and supporting preschool teachers to implement it autonomously in their classrooms.

AB  - This paper deals within a context where technology plays a pivotal role in education. In this sense, it is essential to highlight the emergence of new competencies and skills in education due to technological advancements. Legislative frameworks have been developed to incorporate digital literacy, access to robotics, and computational thinking, between others. Hence, this review and meta-analysis aim at identifying the influence of robotics activities on computational thinking through a PRISMA-guided review. The findings reveal that interventions conducted in early childhood education significantly impact computational thinking. Results also showcase that, despite perceived barriers related to technology accessibility, the presence of legislation and contexts prioritizing these competencies is more relevant than the digital access gap.

AB  - Since computational thinking is a high-level cognitive skill and its conceptual framework has not yet been clarified, the assessment of this skill is problematic. While there is no consensus in the literature about the components of computational thinking, the abstraction component is located at a point where opinions intersect. In addition, it is predicted that computer science unplugged activities will improve computational thinking, and there is limited research examining this effect. As a result, this research aims to demonstrate the alleged effects of computer science unplugged activities on abstraction skill which is considered the critical component of computational thinking. The study, which was planned with a mixed methods research design, lasted 8 weeks. Quantitative data were obtained from the abstraction skill test developed by the researchers, while qualitative data were obtained from observations and task- based interviews after each activity. Quantitative findings showed that computer science unplugged activities significantly improve abstraction skills and thus computational thinking. Qualitative findings not only revealed that developments in the six abstracting steps caused this significant difference but also identified abstracting steps where the effect of each activity was limited. Suggestions for organizing activities to improve these steps are given. Finally, suggestions are presented for the conceptual framework of computational thinking based on abstraction.

AB  - The healthy development of cognitive functions, including executive functions, has been shown to depend mainly on the experiences and learning opportunities of people, especially during childhood. Over the past few years, researchers have been studying the impacts of diverse types of interventions on children’s cognitive development in which computational thinking programs are a recent field. This pilot study evaluated the effect of computational thinking training based on the “Programming for Children” program on the executive functions of children aged 10 and 11 years: working memory, inhibition, and planning (N = 30). The results showed that children in the experimental group improved on tests of visuospatial working memory, cognitive inhibition, and sequential planning compared with the control group. However, tests of verbal working memory, memory strategy, and visual spatial planning did not show any observed changes. Although this was an exploratory study, and its findings should be interpreted cautiously due to the small sample size, the findings support the relevance and feasibility of conducting similar larger studies with larger samples.

AB  - Computational thinking has been promoted as an impactful 21st-century skillset that can be transferred to many other disciplines and problem scenarios. With the proliferation of age-appropriate coding platforms for young children, computational thinking has become increasingly popular in early childhood settings. However, there is a lack of research on introducing coding and computational thinking to teacher training in early childhood education. To empower early childhood teachers in the digital society, this study introduced 17 early childhood teachers to robot programming and computational thinking through the ‘CT4ECE’ professional development program, which includes three phases: Learn, Practice, and Reflect & Improve. Results of pre- and post-intervention surveys revealed that the CT4ECE program significantly enhanced teachers' robotics and pedagogical knowledge, as well as their attitudes towards computational thinking, especially their interest in and their view of using computational thinking in classroom practice. Post-intervention interviews indicated that participation in CT4ECE helped educators gain a basic understanding of both coding robots and computational thinking suitable for young children due to a structured change process for teachers' professional learning. This study establishes a strong foundation for enhancing and expanding the CT4ECE program, ultimately equipping teachers and children with the necessary skillsets to thrive in the digital future.

AB  - The purpose of the current study is to investigate the effects of the unplugged computational thinking (CT) integrated STEM (UCT-STEM) approach and STEM approach on early childhood pre-service teachers’ CT skills (creativity, algorithmic thinking, critical thinking, problem solving, cooperativity, communication). The study was conducted with a total of 70 early childhood pre-service teachers. Quasi-experimental design was used; activities based on the UCT-STEM approach were administered to the experimental group and activities based on the STEM approach were administered to the control group. Post-test scores for CT skills showed a statistically significant difference in favour of the experimental group. It was concluded that the UCT-STEM approach was more effective in developing the pre-service teachers’ CT skills than the STEM approach. The current study presents an important finding to the literature in terms of the developed STEM and UCT-STEM contents and how these contents improve pre-service teachers’ CT skills. The STEM and UCT-STEM content provides significant information in terms of teacher practices. At the same time, this study offers important implications for program developers and policy-makers to integrate these innovative educational approaches into both early childhood education and teacher education programs.

AB  - The integration of computational thinking (CT) to enhance creativity in design students has often been underexplored in design education. While design thinking has traditionally been the cornerstone of university design pedagogy and remains essential, the increasing role of digital tools and artificial intelligence in modern design practices presents new opportunities for innovation. By introducing CT alongside design thinking, students can expand their creative toolkit and engage with emerging technologies more effectively. Although many design students may have limited experience with programming, incorporating accessible, no-code tools can help them confidently embrace computational methods, unlocking new pathways for creative exploration and innovation. This study proposes an alternative approach to improve the motivation of design students by introducing machine learning tools into product design processes. We developed an experimental pedagogy in which 56 industrial design university students learned how to use Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (Weka), a machine learning tool, for three hours of design work a week, for a total of eight weeks. Our covariate analysis of data collected in the pretest and posttest shows that the general learning motivations in the group using Weka are significantly higher than those in the group without Weka. However, no significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of learning strategies, collaboration, or critical thinking. Students using Weka spent more time focusing on model training and tended to improve their algorithmic thinking, and the introduction of Weka appeared to enhance their motivation to learn. On the other hand, these students might have been focusing on working individually at their computers, potentially neglecting communication and collaboration. The findings suggest that teaching machine learning applications without requiring coding has the potential to boost design students' motivation to engage with CT skills, though care must be taken to maintain collaborative practices.

AB  - There is increasing effort to integrate Computational Thinking (CT) curricula across all education levels. Therefore, research on CT assessment has lately progressed towards developing and validating reliable CT assessment tools, which are crucial for evaluating students' potential learning progress and thus the effectiveness of suggested curricular programs. Several CT assessment tools were developed for elementary, high-school, and university students over the last years. Moreover, associations between CT scores and other cognitive abilities were unraveled. However, studies on the topic in primary school level are scarce. Like the general concept of intelligence, CT remains broadly defined as the ability to combine algorithmic operations to form complex solutions in order to solve problems effectively, utilizing concepts of computer science with or without the use of computers. In this study, we aimed at specifying a cognitive definition of CT, focusing on the under-investigated population of primary school children. Since validated assessment tools for this age group were not available, we adapted a validated CT test, which was initially designed for middle school students. In our study participated 192 third and fourth graders. The analyses revealed promising results on the reliability of the adapted CT assessment for primary school students. Moreover, findings indicated CT's positive associations with i. complex numerical abilities, ii. verbal reasoning abilities, and iii. non-verbal visuospatial abilities. Our results indicate similarities but also differences in associations of CT with other cognitive abilities in primary school children compared to other age groups. In summary: i. numerical abilities seem to associate with CT at the primary school level, whereas this seems not the case later on in education, ii. verbal abilities seem to associate with CT both along primary and secondary education levels, and iii. non-verbal reasoning abilities seem to associate with CT from primary education level to the university level and beyond. These differences imply that several basic cognitive abilities support CT abilities and CT development differentially across ages.

AB  - The concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI), born as the possibility of simulating the human brain's learning capabilities, quickly evolves into one of the educational technology concepts that provide tools for students to better themselves in a plethora of areas. Unlike the previous educational technology iterations, which are limited to instrumental use for providing platforms to build learning applications, AI has proposed a unique education laboratory by enabling students to explore an instrument that functions as a dynamic system of computational concepts. However, the extent of the implications of AI adaptation in modern education is yet to be explored. Motivated to fill the literature gap and to consider the emerging significance of AI in education, this paper aims to analyze the possible intertwined relationship between students’ intrinsic motivation for learning Artificial Intelligence during the COVID-19 pandemic; the relationship between students’ computational thinking and understanding of AI concepts; and the underlying dynamic relation, if existing, between AI and computational thinking building efforts. To investigate the mentioned relationships, the present empirical study employs mediation analysis based upon collected 137 survey data from Universidad Politécnica de Madrid students in the Institute for Educational Science and the School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering during the first quarter of 2022. Findings show that intrinsic motivation mediates the relationship between perceived Artificial Intelligence learning and computational thinking. Also, the research indicates that intrinsic motivation has a significant relationship with computational thinking and perceived Artificial Intelligence learning.

AB  - Computational thinking is widely recognized as an essential skill for adapting to the current era, with programming learning being the most effective means to develop it. It is recommended that computational thinking and learning programming be introduced as early as elementary school. However, elementary school students often possess limited prior knowledge of programming, posing challenges in their learning process. The graphic organizers (GOs) may serve as a bridge between students’ existing knowledge and new learning, facilitating a deeper processing of the overall information and thereby enhancing the learning process. This can be particularly advantageous for early-stage learners when grappling with difficult subjects. Consequently, this study employed GOs to assist elementary school students in their computational thinking and programming learning, employing a quasi-experiment design to evaluate their effectiveness. The results showed that although all students demonstrated awareness of applying computational thinking to solve problems, those exposed to GO-based instruction exhibited higher levels of computational thinking, programming skills, and flow experiences.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) practices is a critical cognitive tool for students to overcome challenges in this technological era. Few studies investigated CT practices from a development perspective. A two-year intervention was implemented in 30 intervention and 22 control schools in Hong Kong to promote CT education (T1baseline: N = 13,056; T2: N = 16,367; and T3: N = 15,269). Senior primary students (grades 4 to 6) around 8–12 years old were targeted. Among them, 34% were girls at T1baseline. Their learning progression of cognitive development was assessed with a CT practices test. Data were analyzed using item response analysis. Learning trajectories of CT practices were modeled to understand how students’ cognitive development differed between schools. Insights of findings were discussed in bringing CT practices to life.

AB  - Engagement is critical to computational thinking and programming education. However, as multi-dimensional variables, when analyzing how different aspects of engagement in computational thinking tasks influence skills development, it becomes crucial to discern precisely which engagement components intersect with the progression of computational thinking skills. This discernment is pivotal because engagement can vary based on the task nature, the context, and the individual's preferences. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the gender differences in engagement and computational thinking skills and the predictive relationships among these sub-dimensions for boys and girls in an unplugged environment. In this study, a quasi-experiment for 90 sixth-grade students from a north Chinese primary school was performed. By partial least squares–structural equation modeling, students’ models of computational thinking skills and engagement were analyzed, and comparisons of boys and girls were made by analysis of covariance statistics. Results indicated that compared with boys, girls reported higher computational thinking performance and more engagement in unplugged contexts. Furthermore, girls’ computational thinking skills were only predicted by their cognitive engagement, whereas boys’ computational thinking skills were predicted by their behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement. Teachers can adopt these findings to design computational thinking teaching interventions that combine the advantages of unplugged activity and focus on the engagement of boys and girls.

AB  - In this work, we argue for expanding the scope of K-12 computational thinking (CT) integration contexts to include everyday scenarios involving moral reasoning. Epistemic overlap between computational thinking practices and moral reasoning suggest that these contexts are potentially rich sites to see “seeds of CT” in children's reasoning and can provide rich educational pathways for children into CT. Taking a case-study approach, we examine the reasoning of a second-grader, Ollie, on a task involving fair allocation of resources to victims of a natural disaster. Our analysis finds that Ollie's reasoning was rich with seeds of CT (e.g., problem formulation, abstraction, complex-systems thinking) and that empathy served as an important supporting role to the CT. This work has implications for curricular design, suggesting that fairness and resource allocation scenarios with built-in opportunities for empathy might provide rich sandboxes for CT integration.

AB  - Although there are different definitions for computational thinking in the literature, it is possible to define it mainly as problem solving, designing and interpreting new systems by thinking like a computer. According to Wing (2006), computational thinking is a way of designing a system and understanding human behaviors by focusing on the basic concepts of the computer sciences. The recent focus on computational thinking as a key 21 st century skill for all students has led to a number of curriculum initiatives to embed it in K-12 classrooms and to introduce computing ideas to students early during their schooling years. The present study aims to explore the effects of a short, intensive coding and robotics training on the computational thinking skill self-efficacy of middle school students. 24 fifth graders participated in the study and data were collected by means of the Computational Thinking Self-efficacy scale (CTS) and one open-ended question. Analyses of the pre, post and delayed tests revealed significant differences between the pre and post-tests.

AB  - Methodological innovations across social sciences are opening new avenues for conducting research designed to address real-world challenges. The benefits of utilizing the Design-Based Implementation Research (DBIR) approach in public libraries to resolve a persistent problem of practice, a lack of assessment tools to evaluate youth Computational Thinking (CT) programs, is demonstrated. Findings from a three-year, three-phased study utilizing the DBIR approach to design and implement a suite of assessment tools to assess CT programming in public libraries are presented. Guided by the four principles of the DBIR approach, this research produced new knowledge, including identifying CT program outcomes, challenges, and recommendations for designing and implementing assessment tools to measure the impact of public libraries' CT programming. Findings underscore the DBIR approach as a strategy for engaging with practitioners and helping shift their perspectives by resolving practice problems and facilitating the design of sustainable solutions.

AB  - Although there is controversy surrounding rewards and competition in education, they are key elements in digital game-based learning (DGBL). Research on the influence of rewards and competition in DGBL often yields mixed results, suggesting a need to investigate individual game elements and their interactions. This study implemented DGBL focusing on computational thinking (CT) in 7th-grade classes. Both quantitative and behavioral data were collected to understand the impact of rewards (power-up or customization) and competition (with or without) on students’ intrinsic motivation, game performance, behaviors, and CT skills. The findings uncovered significant interactions between rewards and competition. Students with both competition and power-up rewards achieved the highest game points but the lowest CT performance, whereas those exposed to the same power-up rewards without competition attained the lowest game points but the best CT performance. Implications are drawn for DGBL research and practice.

AB  - Despite growing interest in early childhood computational thinking (CT), there is a lack of validated assessments for children who are emerging readers. This paper presents validity and reliability evidence of a performance-based assessment of CT using item response theory (IRT) from 272 children aged 4–8. Using a two-parameter logistic model IRT model (2PL IRT), we confirmed that model- and item-level fits are acceptable. Item analyses revealed a high discriminability (M = 2.26, SD = 1.12) and a moderate item difficulty (M = −0.21; SD = 0.86), on average, across 19 items. Reliability analysis demonstrated that the assessment was substantially reliable (marginal reliability: rxx = 0.87). Differential item functioning (DIF) analyses indicated that the assessment estimated children's item parameters fairly, regardless of their gender and age. However, we confirmed gaps in latent ability (θ) of CT by gender and age: boys showed higher latent ability of CT than girls, and old children (above 72 months) showed higher latent ability than young children (below 72 months). Findings suggest the assessment is a fair measure that can serve as a reliable and valid tool to assess CT for children who are emerging readers.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is an important and essential skill for human beings to master in the 21st century. Although CT has received wide attention since this concept was proposed, the current theoretical models have not well defined the complex relations between CT and other cognitive abilities for young children. To provide insight into this gap, the current study proposed a model in which we hypothesized that CT was significantly related to arithmetic fluency that is viewed as an important domain of mathematics. Additionally, arithmetic fluency was predicted to mediate the relations of CT to other cognitive abilities, including reasoning and creativity. This study tested such direct and indirect relations in children aged 5–6 years. Consistent with previous studies on older age groups, the results showed that CT and arithmetic fluency were significantly related to each other and both were significantly related to reasoning ability and creative thinking as well. Moreover, this study, for the first time, indicated that arithmetic fluency totally mediated the relation between CT and reasoning ability, suggesting that these concepts share conceptual commonalities, such as the cognitive processes related to mathematics or/and abstraction; in contrast, arithmetic fluency did not mediate the relation between CT and creative thinking, suggesting that gaining CT skill may exert direct positive effect on the development of creativity. Therefore, despite the root in computer science, CT is associated with many cognitive and learning abilities in other domains, supporting the importance of including CT into early school education.

Learning games offer the potential for innovative, stealth assessments of students' implicit learning from gameplay behaviors. This paper reports on the measurement of implicit CT practices demonstrated by upper elementary- and middle-school students as they play the CT learning game Zoombinis. The process of using the gameplay log data to build valid automated detectors of students' implicit CT practices is discussed. Findings from this study provide implications for analyzing gameplay behaviors at scale, leading to the development of models for the assessment of implicit STEM learning.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is critical for Twenty-first century life. Ensuring equitable access to CT depends on preparing teachers to integrate CT into disciplinary curricula. We report on the design, evaluation, and outcomes of the Computational Thinking Unplugged for Science (CT-UP-S) professional development program for inservice science teachers. Our process-based approach to CT significantly improved teachers CT understanding and CT/science integration self-efficacy by systematically linking CT practices to scaffold the generation of unplugged algorithms. Additionally, we found that the process-based approach provided a framework for teachers' lesson planning and that teachers’ content knowledge moderated their ability to write CT-integrated science lessons.

AB  - Early evidence suggests that robot programming offers an important foundation for spatial reasoning and computational thinking; however, researchers have debated how to introduce young children to these skills. We explored how preschoolers develop understanding of spatial concepts and computational thinking as the children took turns navigating a path during guided play with a programmable robot. Our analysis of the data included a multimodal visualization of the exchanges between the teacher, children, and a programmable robotic device. The findings highlight the effects that arose from the physical-digital convergence of technology integrated into play including: (a) the robot evoked a chain of actions, enacting pedagogic forces that transformed children's learning; (b) children used their own bodies as spatial referents, co-locating themselves in space with the robot; (c) the teacher remained a key actor, providing verbal and nonverbal scaffolding to promote children's understanding and mastery of spatial and computational concepts; and (d) talking with the teacher about spatial concepts combined with the interactions with the robot enhanced children's acquisition of spatial ideas relative to the quantity of children's verbal expressions and complexity of their applied spatial skills and computational thinking.

AB  - Workers in the areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics play a significant role in the sustained growth and stability of the global economy, and, thus constitute a critical component in helping all countries worldwide to prosper. In this context, computational thinking constitutes an important skill to have as it enables workers to develop creative solutions to complex problems. Nonetheless, across all economies worldwide, there is a need to have more workers who are able to think through problems, challenges, and solutions in computational terms. It is thus of utmost importance to integrate the teaching of computational thinking in K-12 education in order to reduce the skills gap between education and the workplace. A pertinent and crucial question that arises is whether teachers have the knowledge and skills to teach students how to think computationally. Existing research shows that teacher education departments do not currently have the knowledge to promote computational thinking in their programs. The present study focuses on two aspects of computational thinking, such as, algorithmic thinking and debugging skills with the use of scaffolded programming scripts in an educational technology undergraduate course. The results show statistically significant learning gains in pre-service teachers’ algorithmic thinking and debugging skills in the context of robotic programming activities with LEGO WeDo. Limitations and future research directions are discussed.

AB  - Recent studies identify Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) as a key factor in enhancing cognitive development, particularly within Computational Thinking (CT) literature. However, research gaps remain in understanding how SRL and CT interact from a developmental perspective. Our study designed a program with tailored animations and worksheets to specifically foster students' learning and cognitive development. Using a mixed-methods approach, we administered surveys among 1235 students from 29 Hong Kong primary schools to investigate a dynamic learning system comprising SRL and CT in a large-scale CT program. Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 students to further probe insights. Quantitative findings revealed a mutually reinforcing relationship in the dynamic system, suggesting that higher SRL skills enhance cognitive CT abilities, and vice versa. Complementing these results, qualitative findings showed that integrating animations and worksheets into the CT program significantly boosted students' SRL and cognitive development. These findings have significant implications for educational practices and curriculum design. Schools should consider implementing SRL strategies, such as proactive goal setting and reflective evaluation, within their curricula to promote students’ cognitive development. Furthermore, strategic investments in educational technology, including collaborations with EdTech developers, are essential to create effective, pedagogically sound tools that enhance learning outcomes. These insights provide valuable guidance for creating a supportive SRL environment that fosters cognitive development in primary school education.

AB  - In recent years, there has been increasing interest in integrating Computational Thinking (CT) into elementary schools. However, few studies have focused on teachers’ perceptions. This study aims to examine teachers' perceptions to bridge the gap between theory and practice. The study analysed teachers’ perceptions of integrating CT into school subjects through the constructionist approach, using Scratch a leading programming platform inspired by Resnick's Lifelong Kindergarten Constructionist model. Over a school year, 31 teachers participated in a professional development program and applied this model in their classrooms. The teachers were interviewed to capture their perceptions of learning and teaching using a constructionist method. The findings revealed that teachers with creative arts experience fully embraced the model, while others partially adopted it. Teachers recognized the benefits of constructionist teaching in fostering creativity, motivation, and engagement among students. However, they struggled with balancing these benefits with school demands and constraints. Challenges included managing time effectively within constraints of school and ensuring curriculum alignment. Despite this, many teachers found that the constructionist approach positively impacted students' learning engagement and personal development. By addressing the identified challenges, teacher education designers, curriculum developers, and schools can develop practices for closing the gap between theory and practice.

AB  - Educational research on predicting learners’ computer programming performance has yielded practical implications that guide task designs in computer education. There have been attempts to investigate learners’ computer programming patterns using high-frequency and automated data collection. This approach can be considered as process-based analysis as opposed to outcome-based analysis (i.e., the use of test or exam scores). In this process-based approach to investigate learners’ computer programming process, we included two critical constructs in our research, self-regulated learning and computational thinking skills. We aimed to identify learners’ computer programming patterns in the context that novice students learn a computer programming language, Python, in an online coding environment. We examined the relationships between the learners’ coding patterns, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills. Initially, we adopted a traditional approach with the aggregate data of learners’ computer programming behaviors. We then utilized a computational analytics approach to learner performance, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills, with ever-changing computer programming patterns. In our initial approach, the indicators of aggregate computer programming data were not associated with learners' learning performance and computational thinking skills. In the computational analysis approach, many indicators revealed significant differences between the identified patterns regarding computational thinking skills and self-regulated learning. Recommendations about the use of programming log data analysis methods and future scaffolding for computer programming learners are addressed.

AB  - In the field of education, research has consistently emphasized mathematical creative thinking as a crucial component of 21st-century skills. Thus, this cross-sectional study examines the predictors of such thinking by specifically focusing on the roles of perceived creativity, creative self-efficacy, and computational thinking. The participants consisted of 896 secondary school students (52.9 % female; 47.1 % male) in Indonesia who were asked to complete a series of online questionnaires and tests. For analysis, structural equation modeling was employed, demonstrating satisfactory construct validity and instrument reliability. Based on the results, there was a positive association between computational thinking and mathematical creative thinking. In addition, perceived creativity had a positive impact on mathematical creative thinking, whereas creative self-efficacy showed a negative association. As for the empirical model, it revealed that computational thinking plays a mediating role, connecting perceived creativity and creative self-efficacy to mathematical creative thinking. The findings suggest that incorporating these skills and related variables into the mathematics curriculums in schools is essential for preparing students for success in the 21st century.

AB  - Previous studies have explored the relationship between computational thinking (CT) and creativity. However, a consensus has yet to be reached since both CT and creativity varied in ideation and assessment. To uncover the cognitive mechanism underlying the interplay between CT and creativity, we conduct a scoping review of 26 empirical studies published in 2006–2024. Our findings suggested that the effects of working memory varied in the interplay between CT and creativity due to differences in age range, neural network activation regions, and measurements. Intellectual abilities, including algorithmic fluency, reasoning ability, and coding ability, showed cognitive transfer effect on CT skills but not necessarily on creativity, suggesting that cognitive abilities embracing more intelligent elements may contribute to the functional connectivity in CT neural networks but only partly overlapped with creativity involved networks. Although executive functions (working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control) play a crucial role in both CT and creativity, their contributions to the CT-creativity interplay are still rarely studied. Future research should explore the CT-creativity relationship from the perspective of neuroscience.

Sixty-six papers were selected for this systematic review and analyzed for patterns in relation to the implementation of CS education in K-12 schools and its impact on the development of students’ CT skills. Although educational interventions have not always been successful in CS education, this review provides strong evidence that overall, CS education promotes the development of students’ CT in the K-12 setting while improving their creative and critical thinking skills. We recommend early access to CS education, various innovative instructional approaches to CS education and appropriate support and guidance for student learning.

AB  - Recently, the development of computational thinking (CT) skills has become widespread in the whole world. There is a consensus to develop students’ CT skills through unplugged and plugged-in programming. However, the choice of programming approaches taught in schools is arbitrary and few studies have compared the effectiveness differences between unplugged and plugged-in programming. This study aimed to explore the differences between unplugged and plugged-in programming in developing CT skills of students in Grades 1-2 students. It also explored the joint effects of students’ gender, programming experience, programming interest, and programming confidence with different programming approaches on CT skills. The quasi-experimental research approach was used to conduct 10 weeks of unplugged, plugged-in, and regular programming activities with 124 Grades 1-2 students. The results found that unplugged programming promoted CT skills more in the early primary grades than plugged-in programming. We found that boys and students with programming experience in unplugged group performed significantly better in CT skills than in plugged-in group. Moreover, the improvement of CT skills of students in unplugged group was positively correlated with the level of their programming interest and programming confidence. However, these were not observed in plugged-in group. The results of this study can provide precise guidance for teaching CT skills to early primary school students and provide references for CT education.

AB  - This paper presents an investigation that compares and analyzes the interactions of three groups of pre-and-primary school children with three different storytelling systems. We identify emerging patterns through which they engaged in what we refer to as narrative computational thinking. The latter describes broadened aspects of narrative literacy practices that are linked to computational thinking. By applying a multicase study approach and through various vignettes, we illustrate how children applied computational thinking to understand and influence the narrative possibilities offered by the different tools. Our results illustrate circumstances under which digital storytelling activities provide a favorable basis for narrative computational thinking, and that when computational thinking functions as a scaffold for story creation, it encourages a blend of creativity and computational thinking, providing a compelling approach to introducing emerging digital literacies to young children in a narrative context.

AB  - In this study, it is aimed to identify the computational thinking skills used by gifted and talented students in integrated STEM activities based on the EDP. The case study design, a qualitative research method, is employed in the study. The participants consist of gifted and talented students attending the Science and Arts Center. Integrated STEM activities based on the EDP were conducted over the course of ten weeks and among these activities, robotic and 3D modeling-based robot construction activities using Lego sets are addressed in the present study. The STEM activity booklet, researchers' fieldnotes, and teaching process video recordings were used as data collection tools in the study. Data that was collected was analyzed through content analysis. It was seen that gifted and talented students participating in integrated STEM activities based on the EDP make active use of critical thinking skills while providing explanations, making associations, questioning information, giving justifications, solving problems, thinking creatively, making generalizations, and attempting to convince others; as for the instances of defining problems, creating solutions, and evaluating the effectiveness of the solution, the students were observed to actively use their problem-solving skills. The detailed account provided by the study on the way robotic and 3D robot modeling activities improve the computational thinking skills of gifted and talented students contributes to the required educational support and to the existing body of literature.

AB  - In the artificial intelligence age, cultivating young children's computational thinking (CT) has sparked tremendous attention. Programmable robotics is a developmental-appropriate and screen-free means that provides young children with great opportunities to learn programming and develop CT. However, it is reported that young children might have difficulties learning abstract CT concepts. As a helpful pedagogical facilitator, metaphors can help turn abstract concepts into more concrete and clear concepts that learners are familiar with. Therefore, this research proposed a metaphor-based robot programming (MRP) approach and explored its impact on young children's CT and behavioral patterns. A total of 118 children aged 5–6 were recruited in this experiment with two conditions: the experimental group adopted the metaphor-based robot programming (MRP) approach while the control group used the conventional robot programming (CRP) approach. Results revealed that children who adopted the MRP approach outperformed children who adopted the CRP approach on CT. In addition, behavioral analysis indicated that the proposed MRP approach could facilitate children's superior learning performance and more positive learning behaviors, so as to help them achieve learning objectives. Accordingly, this study can provide insightful guidance and inspiration for future research on effective programming teaching and CT development for young children.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is a necessary skill for students. It is as important as the other essential skills such as reading, writing, and arithmetic. However, how to improve students’ CT in robotics is still to be explored. Hence, this study examined the effects of computer supported project-based learning (CSPBL) on students’ CT and learning engagement through comparing students’ CT and engagement in two courses instructed by the same instructor (one instructed with a traditional method, the other instructed with CSPBL). Participants were seventy-nine students from a university in China. Questionnaires, interviews, and project analysis were used to measure students’ CT and learning engagement. The comparative results of self-reports and final projects indicated that the CSPBL enhanced students’ CT. The simulation project training based on the SenseStudy learning platform in CSPBL helped students debug the programming code, optimize the algorithm design, and improve their algorithmic thinking, cooperation, and problem solving during the program error correction. The CSPBL also improved students’ engagement in learning, especially for those with more than one year of programming experience. It was found that the CSPBL was effective in terms of improving students’ CT and engagement in robotics learning. This study provides teachers with practical suggestions to conduct effective robotics instruction.

AB  - Malaysia has introduced computational thinking skills as part of a curriculum integration update to meet the global trends in 21st-century education, focusing on empowering digital literacy. Nevertheless, a preliminary investigation revealed an apparent lack of understanding of computational thinking skills in general among teachers. The study explores the feasibility of developing a localized E-learning system to train computational thinking skills among teachers. An E-learning system, termed as myCTGWBL, was developed on the basis of a newly proposed conceptual framework to present computational thinking teaching–learning repertoire to the teachers. The hypothesis is that myCTGWBL would develop teachers' computational thinking and its position in teaching–learning understanding. myCTGWBL relevance was tested through DeLone and McLean's information system and Urbach's collaboration quality construct. To determine the success factors, partial least squares structural equation modeling was used. A total of 369 teachers participated in a two-stage survey. Participants' understanding of computational thinking and perceptions were recorded at the pre- and post-intervention phases. Open-ended questions of the surveys were analyzed using a simple text analysis technique. The closed-ended questions surveys were analyzed using SPSS Statistics 22.0. A significant improvement in teachers' computational thinking teaching–learning repertoire in a relatively short period has been recorded. Teachers also demonstrated increased confidence in the future delivering computational thinking-based lessons. The E-learning conceptual framework has illustrated the predictive power between user intent, user satisfaction, and Computational thinking (CT) knowledge benefits. Results demonstrate that myCTGWBL could be used to guide future planning when establishing CT knowledge acquisition initiatives, particularly among teachers.

AB  - Efforts to incorporate computational thinking (CT) into academic courses have been gaining popularity. CT is a problem-solving skill that is crucial in the 21st century. CT may be used to support language education. Courses in English as a foreign language often need an effective writing component that includes writing organization and language use, as demonstrated by the poor writing samples often generated by students of these courses. To address the problems, CT, which is a higher-order mode of problem-solving and knowledge acquisition optimization, was used. The experimental group was instructed using the CT teaching model based on CT's essential components (decomposition, generalization, abstraction, algorithm, and evaluation), whereas the control group was taught using the conventional method. In total, 58 undergraduate students divided into two groups participated in this study. A combination of writing, CT skills, surveys, and interviews were used to collect data according to an experimental design. The collected quantitative data were analyzed through analysis of covariance and structural equation modeling, and the MAXQDA 2022software was used to analyze the collected qualitative data. The results of this study indicate that incorporating CT into an English writing course enhances the writing and higher-order thinking skills of students. The CT concepts helps students develop critical thinking skills by evaluating the text and identifying potential issues or improvements. Additionally, it allows students to use their skills to create unique writing solutions, which can boost English writing creativity.

AB  - Computational thinking education has become an increasingly popular topic among practitioners and researchers. However, rare is known how to effectively teach and learn computational thinking in early childhood education. To address this knowledge gap, this systematic review examined 26 studies on the teaching and learning of computational thinking in early childhood education from 2010 to 2022. The content knowledge, tools, pedagogical design, assessment methods, and learning outcomes were analyzed. Results indicated that, with age-appropriate instructional design, children could develop early concepts and skills of computational thinking, as well as other related skills such as communication, collaboration, and problem solving. Across the studies, we found that most studies used quantitative research methods, with direct assessment and observation being the most. Several challenges were identified: (1) achieving a deeper learning of computational thinking; (2) a lack of valid and reliable computational thinking assessments for children with a wider age range; (3) selecting appropriate learning tools; and (4) designing age-appropriate activities for young learners. Although with these challenges, computational thinking education could bring new learning opportunities and enhance children's computational thinking skills, as well as other non-cognitive skills such as critical thinking, body-material interaction, and hand-eye coordination. This systematic review informs future endeavors in theorizing a digital learning framework that can integrate computational thinking into early childhood education.

AB  - Teacher competencies encompass the dimensions of knowledge and attitudes, yet few studies have analysed teachers' latent profiles in relation to the interaction between these two dimensions. Latent profile analysis, which examines the interplay between variables to distinguish subgroups of individuals, has recently emerged in studies of computational thinking (CT) as a method for identifying student profiles. However, the latent profiles of CT teachers have not yet been analysed. We therefore analysed the latent profiles of a sample of 493 teachers who had participated in a teacher development programme in CT, according to their knowledge and perceived usefulness of CT. Three profiles were identified: (1) highly knowledgeable with high perceived usefulness, (2) knowledgeable with low perceived usefulness, and (3) less knowledgeable with low perceived usefulness. Qualitative data further triangulated these findings. We also examined the learning achievement of 12,105 students taught by these teachers. Students taught by highly knowledgeable teachers with a high perceived sense of usefulness demonstrated significantly better achievement than their peers. Our findings highlight the importance of nurturing both knowledge of and perceived usefulness in CT. They also provide valuable insights for similar teacher development programmes, emphasizing the importance of peer mentoring support for less knowledgeable teachers. Additionally, we underscore the value of having teachers create artefacts using CT for instructional purposes, allowing them to gain firsthand experience of its usefulness. As few studies have explored teachers' latent profiles based on the dimensions of knowledge and attitudes, the contribution of this study extends beyond the domain of CT.

AB  - We designed a controlled trial protocol that seeks to contribute to cognitive science by studying the effect of thought training on children's executive functions. The study design is a cluster randomized controlled trial, with intra-subject and inter-subject evaluation, with two parallel groups: an experimental group and a TAU control group. With three measures, pre-test, post-test, and follow-up after three months. The participants will be children aged 9 to 11. The allocation will be randomized by groups and not individually. The sample will be a minimum of 44 participants. The primary measures will be neuropsychological tests to assess executive functions. Secondary measures will be a computational thinking test, neuropsychological tests to assess metacognition and attention, and an acceptability scale. The experimental group will participate in the COGNI-MACHINE computational thinking training designed by the first author. The training frequency will be twice a week in 60 min sessions for 12 weeks. The TAU control group will receive computer science classes as usual during the same time as the experimental group. The evaluators taking the measurements will be blinded to the assignment. The investigators in charge of the intervention will be blinded to the results of the evaluations.

AB  - Negative feedback can temporarily relieve negative Chinese transfer (NCT) in English as a foreign language (EFL) syntactic writing by focusing only on the surface writing constructs, neglecting that EFL writing is an embodiment of the process by which higher-order thinking operates. To solve the problem, the researchers conducted a pretest, interventionist group dynamic assessment (IGDA) in the form of negative feedback based on computational thinking (CT), higher-order thinking, and post-test quasi-experimental design, with a control group receiving the direct correction feedback instructing model to mitigate the NCT in EFL syntactic writing. We analyzed the syntactic writing types and frequencies of the NCT obtained through repeated-measure ANOVA and confirmed by qualitative data through video recording. The results indicated that IGDA in the form of negative feedback based on CT principal skills could (1) significantly decrease syntactic writing errors caused by the NCT, (2) improve learners’ EFL writing performance, and finally, (3) elevate the computer as an essential mediation tool. This innovative instructing mode of intervening with writing constructs and higher-order thinking and bringing about deeper thinking and creativity contributes to the EFL writing teaching methodology in a foreign language higher education.

AB  - The tenure system in the United States places significant importance on teaching effectiveness. To date, students' evaluations of teaching (SETs) have been the reigning mechanism for assessing effective teaching. However, prior work has shown that SETs are often biased against underrepresented groups and minorities. The present study analyzes options for effective teaching assessments, which include evaluating final grades and measuring the differences between students’ pre- and post-tests (normalized gain) using standard instruments. The content area and the instrument used in this study originated in the computational thinking field, which has a widespread presence in engineering, where minorities are at a disadvantage. This study obtained a total of 88 student participants from four sections of an introductory engineering course at a Southwestern institution. The study utilized a computational thinking diagnostic (CTD) to inform the course teaching approach (the intervention). Results show that (a) normalized learning gains correlated moderately with SETs, (b) final grades correlated strongly with SETs, (c) final grades correlated strongly with normalized learning gains, (d) the educational intervention based on the CTD significantly affected student learning, and (e) SET comments affect evaluations. The implications include the notion that standardized instrument-driven instruction and evaluations can increase the success of minorities on both sides of the classroom. The purpose of this manuscript is to invite the Heliyon readership to get involved in the development of related instruments and to incorporate these measures of learning into their instruction so biases are avoided or minimized.

AB  - In the digital age, our lives become more dependent on technology, yet the digital gap is intensifying especially because most people lack digital literacy. As a modest step to handle this challenge, we designed a course named "Play with me in Code" to develop pre-service teachers' (PSTs) thinking skills and expose them to learning by creation using computational thinking and programming as part of the constructionism paradigm. The added value of using Scratch in the context of teacher education lies not only in familiarity with a programming language but with an emphasis on experiencing self-directed learning tackling with problem solving situations, creativity, socioemotional competencies, and logical computational thinking. The present study aims to examine 25 PSTs' attitudes towards facing challenges of coding with Scratch. To this end, a mixed-method approach was activated by using questionnaires, blog posts, and reflections. Findings revealed that the learning environment encouraged PSTs' use of abstraction and decomposition to address a complex problem or to design a complex game. Study's conclusions relate to the importance of providing PSTs opportunities to experience learning by programming for raising their awareness of the importance of enhancing thinking skills and creativity in the future.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT), a way to think about solving problems, is recognized as a basic skill for the 21st century. Although game-based learning (GBL) has been shown to improve student's CT skills, students may fail to self-evaluate or debate as they play games, thus failing to develop higher-order thinking. Also not widely explored is how teachers are to practice the CT core competencies during the learning process to cultivate students' problem-solving thinking. As the adoption of student-generated questions (SGQ) is an instructional strategy to promote higher-order thinking, we develop a GBL platform that uses this strategy to enhance students' CT skills, learning motivation, and learning confidence. For this purpose, fifty-three primary school students were recruited for this study, and data were collected during four classes of experimental CT activities. This study shows that the experimental group using the SGQ strategy with a GBL platform exhibited significantly higher CT skills than the control group. In addition, with respect to learning motivation and learning confidence it is found that the experimental group also outperformed the control group. This confirms that integrating the SGQ strategy and CT core competencies fosters higher-order cognitive thinking in students in problem-solving through gamification of the learning environment, resulting in higher motivation and confidence to complete experimental activities.

AB  - Teacher preparation programs currently struggle to (a) address the challenges preparing students to use computing principles, and (b) do so in ways that apply a critical lens toward societal inequities. In this paper, we describe our (1) integrated STEM and computational thinking (CT) teacher preparation program; (2) response to barriers educators face in preparing students to critically use computing principles; and (3) examples of the pedagogical practices teacher candidates developed through the program. We contribute an approach to preparing and empowering educators to support students understanding and use of CT as a lens for advocating for social justice in their lives.

AB  - To effectively utilize artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies such as ChatGPT and realize their novel ethical issues, individuals must have a variety of knowledge and skills about AI. Such knowledge and skills have led to the emergence of AI literacy. Despite the importance of AI literacy in everyday life, little is known about its determinants. To better understand the determinants of AI literacy, we attempted to build a research model relying on previous research and different theoretical frameworks. The model incorporated digital divide, cognitive absorption, and computational thinking. As a major finding from the current study, computational thinking was found to be a significant determinant of AI literacy, which facilitate using, recognizing, and evaluating AI-based technologies. Moreover, we found out that individuals with physical access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) are more expected to use and recognize AI. Also, motivation and skills in using ICTs enable individuals to better evaluate the outcomes of AI-based technologies. The findings also showed that convenient access to ICTs contributes to a deep involvement with AI-based technologies in the use. Further, individuals with higher motivation and skills to use AI technologies are likely to have a pleasant experience after using these technologies.

AB  - Both computational thinking (CT) and creativity have been recognized as key skills for today's learners. Over the last decade, research of both skills in a single context has emerged. In this paper, we present a scoping review of 62 such empirical from 2011 to 2020. Our goal was to have a thorough understanding of the educational settings in which research on both CT and creativity was conducted, the theoretical foundations it has laid down, and the research tools used. Our findings indicate a geographical bias (dominance of the US and prominence of developed European countries), as well as a focus on secondary education and on STEM-related disciplines; this could be explained by the current situation of CT spread. We also found that when studying CT and creativity jointly, it is most common to define CT in a broader perspective than merely programming of computer science. Additionally, while creativity is largely referred to as product-related, CT is barely referred to as such. Taken together, our findings point out some gaps in the current research of CT and creativity and suggest how it should be expended on the fertile grounds of creativity, as the latter crosses geographical, age, and subject borders. Doing so may build a bridge between CT and creativity in a way that will benefit both.

AB  - This paper sheds light on 3–5-year-old children’s enactments of computational empowerment (CE) in activities with computational thinking (CT). CT is widely elaborated on as a universal problem-solving approach and a skill set necessary for thriving in today’s digitized societies. Scholars claim that CT for all should be ensured from an early age, and several studies develop and examine age-appropriate technological tools, as well as pedagogical approaches, for young children’s learning of CT. Based on 1.5 years of co-designing for children’s situated CT in two Danish kindergartens, the present study conducts a socioculturally informed analysis of video-observed interactions between children and educational robots. The findings display how children and robots engage in interactions that transcend children’s mastery of CT in any narrow sense. This is examined as situated enactments of CE; as children’s critical and informed decisions regarding the roles that technologies, in this case educational robots, can play in their institutionally situated social lives. The paper concludes that children’s various enactments of CE deserve scholarly and professional attention, both as an important prerequisite for, and as a necessary limitation to, the implementation of CT in kindergartens.

AB  - Since the end of the 20th century, the digitalization of society, including the educational systems, has been growing exponentially. At the same time, education systems have been evolving towards competency-based assessment. Likewise, at the beginning of this century, the idea of Computational Thinking was resurrected by J. Wing, for solving problems and designing systems using concepts of computer science. Today, we can see how all these questions are taking shape in a new competence, called Computational Thinking, related to others that already exist. In this paper, we have studied the skills of Computational Thinking in university students, focusing on abstraction and its possible relationship with other factors. Results conclude that the students fail in relation to abstraction and in algorithmic thinking. Although the ability of abstraction is not easy to measure, a linear regression analysis has been carried out in order to determine its possible study.

AB  - Teaching computational thinking (CT) has become a priority for educators and policymakers tasked with educating and training students for future jobs which are predicted to be increasingly automated. Recent research on effective instructional interventions for developing computational thinking skills, including algorithmic and critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity, and cooperativity, suggests that teaching and learning CT can improve student academic performance. In fact, the extant literature is quite sanguine about the topic of CT. However, few studies have attempted to establish a relationship between CT skills and academic performance. In the present cross-sectional study, we employ path analysis to model the structural relationship between self-reported CT skills and academic performance of a sample of 81 computer science undergraduates enrolled at a Southwestern American university. We found few direct relationships between CT skills and academic performance. We only find a significant positive relationship between creativity and academic performance and a significant negative relationship between cooperativity and academic performance. Our findings are surprising considering the abundant research promoting computational thinking as a key component of 21st century skills. The findings call for further in-depth analysis of computational thinking and the influence on students’ learning and learning outcomes. We discuss our results with respect to recent educational mandates for including CT and instructional alignment in school curricula. Our findings contribute to the existing discussion by helping to clarify the relationship between CT skills and academic performance in higher education.

AB  - Although studies have shown that computational thinking (CT) can enhance learning processes and outcomes across traditional subjects, they have not shown how teachers might scaffold children's CT processes in a technology-mediated learning context. This exploratory study examined how teacher talk and technologies impacted the CT of three children (6 to 8 years old). Seven videotaped 90-minute sessions of weekly project-based activities yielded 4,842 turns of talk (2,974 by children). Statistical discourse analysis revealed the following results. After a teacher command, the children more often executed a sequence of actions toward a solution but less often demonstrated problem understanding than otherwise. Following a teacher's open question, the children were more likely to offer logically organized ideas. In response to a teacher's rhetorical question, they more often searched for information. These results inform educators regarding when to use each type of teacher talk to scaffold children's CT processes.

AB  - ChatGPT (generative pre-trained transformer) is one of the artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that have started to be used in programming education. However, the effect of using ChatGPT in programming education on learning processes and outcomes is not yet known. This study investigated the effect of programming education using the ChatGPT on students' computational thinking skills, programming self-efficacy, and motivation toward the lesson. The research was conducted on 45 undergraduate students who took a university-level programming course. The research was carried out according to the experimental design with the pretest-posttest control group. Students were randomly divided into experimental (n = 21) and control (n = 24) groups. While the experimental group students benefited from the ChatGPT during the weekly programming practices, the control group students did not use this tool. Research data were obtained through the computational thinking scale, computer programming self-efficacy scale, and learning motivation in computer programming courses scale. Research findings revealed that the experimental group students' computational thinking skills, programming self-efficacy, and motivation for the lesson were significantly higher than the control group students. In line with this result, it can be said that it may be useful to benefit from AI technologies such as ChatGPT in programming trainings. The research findings, it was emphasized how the most effective use of AI support in the lessons could be made, and various suggestions were made for researchers and educators in this regard.

AB  - In this paper, we explore how the theoretical notion of possibility space offers a way to study how children's computational thinking develops as a process. Drawing on embodied notions of cognition, we first examine the literature that supports how children's computational thinking emerges as a possibility space that involves conceptualizing possible actions in a given moment, deciding which action to take by anticipating the results of a possible action, and learning from the actions that they have taken. We then use a grounded approach to analyze the problem-solving process of two 5th-grade children who engaged in an educational robotics activity over two 50-minute class periods. The findings lend support for approaching children's computational thinking as a cycle of action-taking that includes conceptualizing, anticipating, and taking action. The findings also support the pedagogical practice of having children predict the results of a computer program to enhance their computational thinking. Implications for the way that teachers can support children in learning to conceptualize what is possible and take action from it are discussed.

AB  - Predictive learner modelling is crucial for personalized education. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great success in education, their potential in learner modelling via image data is unexplored. This research introduces a novel and interpretable approach for Image-based Learner Modelling (ImageLM) using CNNs and transfer learning to model learners’ performance and accordingly classify their computational thinking solutions. The approach integrates Grad-CAM, enabling it to provide insights into its decision-making process. Findings show that our custom CNN outperforms other models (namely ResNet, VGG, and Inception), with 83% accuracy in predicting solution correctness. More importantly, the ImageLM approach identifies the regions that contribute the most to the predictions, shedding light on learners' computational thinking knowledge and advancing toward trustworthy AI for education. These results underline the potential of utilizing imagery data from learners’ activities during the learning process to predict their performance, especially in challenging environments like programming where traditional feature extraction and learning might struggle.

AB  - The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has led to the proliferation of computational thinking (CT) education. However, research on unplugged activities’ influence in elementary math classrooms is limited, despite some exploring programming's cognitive benefits. This study presents both qualitative and quantitative analyzes stemming from a ten-week quasi-experimental research endeavor, specifically tailored for third-grade students. The research devised a series of unplugged activities, encompassing mathematical games, hands-on construction of mathematical logic boards, and calculating shopping discounts. The overarching objective was to investigate the impact of these unplugged activities on students’ mathematical creativity and CT. Students participating in a mathematics curriculum based on unplugged activities (N = 47) were compared with students participating in a traditional lecture-based mathematics curriculum (N = 46). The results indicated that unplugged activities exhibited significant advantages in fostering students’ CT and mathematical creativity across three dimensions, namely, problem-posing creativity (t = 5.830, p < 0.01), problem-solving creativity (t = 6.633, p < 0.01), and creative self-efficacy (t = 7.554, p < 0.01). Furthermore, the study revealed a relationship between students’ mathematical creativity as a predictor of CT. The results of the quantitative analysis were supported by the teacher's and students’ interview data, and the students felt excited and interested in the unplugged activities, whereas some students using the lecture-based method reported boredom and lack of interactivity. This research offered valuable insights for mathematics and CT education practice, underscoring unplugged activity as an innovative instructional approach that brings forth new possibilities for traditional mathematics teaching, with potential applications in the K-12 curriculum.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has received worldwide attention due to its alignment with developing 21st century skills such as creativity, problem-solving, and digital competence. With the increasing provision of programming tools such as robotic toys and tablet apps in the sector of early childhood education (ECE), many ECE researchers and practitioners tend to link CT to programming. However, children are reluctant to sustain their interests in programming activities, and may be further demotivated by debugging failures. This multi-group quasi-experimental study aimed to evaluate the effects of a story-inspired approach in bridging the gap between programming and CT for preschool children. Building on previous literature suggesting storytelling as a powerful, culturally responsive pedagogy, 5-year-old children (N=108) were involved in nine weeks of CT learning via one of the three conditions: Story-Inspired Robot Programming (SIRP), Story-Inspired Tablet Programming (SITP), and unplugged CT education. Results revealed that children who participated in the SIRP and SITP conditions showed improved CT scores, relative to unplugged CT education, even after controlling for baseline CT scores. No gender or family socioeconomic effects were found to influence the benefits of story-inspired programming interventions. These findings suggest that storytelling as a culturally responsive approach, whether using robots or tablets as a programming tool, can provide young children with more inclusive and sustainable CT learning experiences.

AB  - Content area K-12 teachers are increasingly asked to integrate computing and computational thinking into their classrooms, yet they often have little experience with computing. The purpose of this study was to understand how science teachers, new to computing and integrating computational thinking into their classrooms, supported students as computational problem solvers. In the project from which this research was drawn, 8th grade science teachers in three US school districts integrated computer game design into their study of climate systems and climate change. We conducted participant observation, collected teacher implementation logs and interviewed 15 teachers engaged in the three-year design research project, Building Systems from Scratch. Analysis through grounded theory yielded several results related to teachers’ orientations, strategies, and use of resources to create systems of distributed expertise. We identified five major themes: a) releasing responsibility to students, b) co-learning with students, c) encouraging students’ independent problem solving, d) building interdependence among students, and e) providing multiple other resources. Findings are discussed in relation to the literature on integrating computational thinking into content area classrooms.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is currently used as an umbrella term in education to describe the processes associated with learning and applying computer science concepts and strategies for problem-solving. Despite a growing body of literature on the subject within education and the development of a grand variety of tools designed to enhance computational thinking abilities, the relations between CT and other cognitive abilities have not been reported in young children. Understanding CT from a cognitive development perspective could be useful for creating targeted interventions tailored for young children. In the present study, we compare a previously reported computational thinking assessment with a battery of nine cognitive tests, which include fluid intelligence, working memory, planning, sequencing, mental rotation, vocabulary, and early math precursors such as numerical transcoding and symbolic magnitude comparison. Mixed-effects linear regressions were implemented with CT as a dependent variable to explore the associations between our variables. A subsample of children who participated in an educational robotics intervention were assessed in their robot programming performance, and its outcomes were compared with their CT assessments. Results suggest temporal sequencing ability and symbolic magnitude comparison are significant predictors of CT in kindergarten. Positive significant associations between robot programming and CT performance are reported.

AB  - The research aims to evaluate the effect of a robotics-based computational thinking program on executive functions and visuospatial skills in preschool children. Additionally, the study will explore the relationship between these three variables and early experiences with toys. The study will be a cluster-randomized controlled trial with pre- and post-intervention measures. Participants will be preschool children aged 5 to 6 years from both public and private institutions. The intervention will involve a new educational robotics device called ROVERSA and will consist of eight sessions distributed over four weeks, with the experimental group placed on a waitlist. To assess executive functions and visuospatial skills, standardized and validated neuropsychological measures will be used, including the Flanker task, the NIH Toolbox Card Sorting Test, the Corsi Block Test, the NEPSY-II Mental Rotation Test, the Pyramid of Mexico from the ENI-2 battery, and the Computational Thinking Test (CTt). Data analysis will begin with a hypothesis tested through ANOVA-MR, and linear regressions will be implemented to assess the relationship between variables. It is expected that the results will contribute to the discussion on teaching computational thinking and educational robotics as early learning experiences and their impact on the cognitive development of children.

AB  - Educators emphasize that computational thinking is especially helpful in raising problem-solving skills, improving logical reasoning, and developing analytical thinking. In this context, the aim of this study is to develop an online, interactive, valid, reliable and useful performance-based assessment tool for measuring computational thinking skills. Data were collected in two stages with three different measurement tools. In the data collection phase, a psychometric scale, a skill test and an interactive web application developed in this study were used. In the study in which a total of 203 high school students participated, it was determined that the students' computational thinking skills were at average level. as a result, a valid and reliable performance-based platform was developed for measuring computational thinking skills. It has also been concluded that the performance-based measurement tool makes a better measurement than the psychometric scale. It is emphasized that computational thinking should be treated as a skill or group of skills, not as a theoretical knowledge, product/portfolio or attitude/perception. Therefore, it is believed that developing performance-based tools for evaluating computational thinking skills and measuring them by using multiple measurement tools will give more accurate results. Considering the developments in computational thinking, it is thought that the study will contribute to the literature.

AB  - Computing education has progressively entered into children's early years. Due to a proliferation of computing education programs and coding tools designed for young children, research on the relationships between computational thinking (CT) and other domains of learning and development is highly warranted. Yet, there is little empirical evidence that shows the relationship between CT and children's overall cognitive functioning. As such, this study explored the relationships between Chinese children's CT and their sequencing ability and self-regulation in early childhood. One hundred and one Chinese young children (Ngirl = 52 and Nboy = 49; Mage = 5.25, SD = 0.73) were recruited and evaluated with three reliable instruments. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that: (1) CT positively predicted sequencing ability (β = 0.27, p < .05) even after controlling for relevant demographic covariates such as age, gender, and family socioeconomic status; (2) CT positively predicted self-regulation (β = 0.47, p < .001) after controlling for demographic covariates. Our findings suggest that CT may be a domain-general ability that is based on cognitive foundations that extend beyond the realm of computing.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is regarded as the conceptual basis required for identifying and solving real-world problems through algorithmic approaches to achieve transferable solutions. Developing students' CT in primary school stages is essential and has received considerable attention. Meanwhile, researchers incorporated digital badges into classrooms to improve students' learning motivation in computer science (CS). However, few solid empirical studies analyze the effects of the digital badges approach in CS education to develop students' CT. Therefore, to bridge this gap, this study designed and implemented a block-based programming course in a primary school and examined the impact of the digital badges approach on pupils' CT skills and self-efficacy and learning motivation in CS. A quasi-experimental design was conducted among 99 third-grade students across three classes. The results revealed that the adapted digital badges in primary school (1) significantly improved the students' CT skills, (2) had no significant positive impact on their CT self-efficacy or learning motivation in CS, and (3) showed no mediating effect of learning motivation on the relationship between CT skills and CT self-efficacy. In addition, we found that whether students could see only their own digital badges or also those of others had no impact on CT skills, self-efficacy, or learning motivation in CS. These findings have implications for the design of digital badge educational interventions intended to promote students' CT and learning motivation.

AB  - Computational thinking refers to a series of cognitive processes involved in solving problems through computational systems. A growing body of studies has managed to demonstrate the correlation between computational thinking and different cognitive domains. In recent decades, multiple studies have taken place that seek to evaluate the effect of computational thinking on higher-order cognitive processes. The current study aims to contribute to this discussion by analyzing the effect of an intervention program in computational thinking on the executive functions of school-age children. In this experimental study, 30 children aged 10 and 11 were randomly assigned to an experimental group and an active control group. The instruments to collect the data were 15 tests of the neuropsychological battery of executive functions and frontal lobes BANFE-2, which were applied to both groups before and after the intervention. The experimental group participated in an 8-week computational thinking intervention during which its participants enrolled in plugged and unplugged activities and carried out block programming language twice a week. The results showed that the intervention had significant effects on executive functions associated with the anterior prefrontal cortex and the dorsolateral cortex, but not those related to the orbitofrontal area.

AB  - Learning coding during early childhood is an effective way for children to practice computational thinking. Aspects of children's motivation can increase the likelihood that children approach computational thinking activities with enthusiasm and deep engagement. Gender inequities may interfere with children's readiness to take advantage of opportunities to build computational thinking skills through activities such as coding. Societal stereotypes can reduce young girls’ motivation to engage with computer science, preventing them from gaining benefits from coding activities designed to support computational thinking. This study examined children's gender stereotypes as well as children's own motivation for computer coding in 363 first- through third-grade children. We assessed gender differences in both stereotypes and motivation, as well as links between the stereotypes that individual children held and their own motivation. Children generally endorsed stereotypes about interest and ability for computer coding that favored their own-gender group, although third-grade girls reported gender-egalitarian beliefs about interest in coding. There were no gender differences in children's motivation for computer coding in terms of their own interest, sense of belonging, or ability self-concepts. Children's stereotypes about their own-gender group were significantly positively correlated with their own motivation for computer coding. These findings suggest that early childhood represents an excellent age for children to begin building computational thinking skills, before girls endorse negative stereotypes about their gender's interest in computer science.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is an essential skill students need if they are to adapt to the rise of digital society, and the evaluation of CT is crucial for enhancing students’ CT. However, the current evaluation of CT is based on a summative paradigm and ignores real CT performance during the assessment process. This study thus used a multimodal cognitive diagnostic model (H-MCDM) of students’ CT based on multimodal data in situational tasks, to achieve precise evaluation and explore the current mastery status of students’ CT and their cognitive and behavioral characteristics. The research results indicate that: 1) students’ CT was at a moderately high level and indicated a good grasp of the CT components of problem decomposition and algorithm design, but students had not yet mastered problem abstraction, 2) a total of six different CT latent patterns were discerned in the overall student results, 3) individual students who shared the same CT latent patterns could differ in their cognitive and behavioral characteristics, while those with different CT latent patterns could share similar characteristics. This study showed that it is possible to capture the degree of students’ mastery of CT and their cognitive and behavioral differences with the same or different CT latent patterns at a granular level, providing a basis for developing individualized strategies to enhance students’ CT.

AB  - In-service elementary school teachers need training to teach computational thinking (CT). A common model for CT professional learning programs includes an initial workshop followed by ongoing support. However, little research has examined the efficacy of ongoing support, the most effective types, and its impact on classroom practices. The current study details a multifaceted CT professional learning program with innovative ongoing support to help elementary school teachers implement the Code.org curriculum. It also empirically investigated the impact of the support on teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT, the effectiveness of each component of the support, and to what extent it affected teachers' classroom practices. Our ongoing support included an additional workshop, grade-level professional learning community (PLC) sessions, instructional videos, and teacher leaders' support. Data included a pre-survey, four post-surveys, lesson observations, a focus group interview, tracking the number of video views, and surveys from PLC participants and teacher leaders. Results indicated that the ongoing support significantly increased teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT. Regarding the effectiveness of the various components of the ongoing support, the additional workshop significantly increased teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT. Teachers valued each component of the support, and this support improved teachers’ classroom practices.

AB  - The present study investigates the debugging process of 526 children in preschool (4–6 aged) when programming a tangible robot. When a child is involved in programming, it is needed to identify and correct errors, or in other words, debug a program. Debugging is a high-level thinking skill and is an essential component closely related to developing Computational Thinking in early childhood education. Though the debugging process is a cognitive function in programming investigated by many researchers in recent decades, most studies are conducted either in primary, secondary education, or higher education concerning beginners or experts in programming. Very few reviews, and some focus on preschool education. Our study set out the following objectives: 1) How do children identify the existence of error and locate it? 2) What types of errors emerge when coding? 3) What type of error is complex for novice programmers? 4) What strategies are developed by novice programmers to debug effectively? and 5) What types of knowledge do novice programmers construct by debugging the tangible robot Bee-Bot? The study follows an iterative model of a design-based research approach. It uses multiple case studies to collect qualitative and quantitative data. The programming intervention was implemented by 30 educators in their classrooms and was based on a scenario-based teaching design. The debugging process was analysed using Klahr & Craven's framework (1988): 1) test and evaluate program, 2) identify bug, 3) represent program, 4) locate bug and 5) correct bug. The main finding is the construction and development of syntactic and semantic knowledge.

AB  - A plethora of programming platforms purports to teach preschool-aged children computational thinking (CT) and coding skills. However, the empirical evidence to support their effectiveness is still in its early stages. A three-week didactic intervention using ScratchJr was conducted to investigate its effectiveness in fostering CT and rudimentary coding skills in a cohort of preschool children (N = 34, aged 4–6 years). While the initial performance mean of the control group (M = 7.07, SD = 2.58) exhibits a statistically significant elevation t (22.64 = 2.23, p = 0.036) vis-à-vis the experimental group (M = 5.35, SD = 1.58), t (22.64) = 2.23, p = 0.0 the terminal performance means of both groups converge closely. However, meticulous data analysis unveils a statistically notable enhancement among preschool participants exposed to the educational intervention involving ScratchJr. Notably, both instructional modalities appear commensurate in nurturing elementary computational tenets, namely modularity and control structures. The experimental cohort outperforms the control group with statistical significance in comprehending potent ideational constructs encompassing representation, algorithms, and hardware/software interplay. Conversely, the control group performs better in grasping the debugging concept than their experimental counterparts. The outcomes lend substantive credence to the efficacy of the distinct programming milieu offered by ScratchJr, underscoring its effectiveness in cultivating CT and coding proficiencies within the preschool demographic.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is crucial for students. Robot-supported learning has emerged as a popular approach for CT cultivation. To understand the effects of robot-supported CT cultivation, the current study conducted a meta-analysis to analyze studies from Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Science Direct databases (2012–2022) which screened using keywords ``computational thinking'' and ``robot''. After further screening, 26 peer-reviewed articles were selected. We synthesized the 33 effect sizes to assess the overall effectiveness of robot-supported learning on CT and its sub-dimensions: concepts, practices, and perspectives. Our findings revealed a medium effect of robot-supported learning on students' CT (g = 0.643), a large effect on CT concepts (g = 0.650), a medium effect on CT practices (g = 0.587), and a huge effect on CT perspectives (g = 1.419). We also explored the moderators (i.e., grade level, study duration, culture, learning strategy, and assessment tool) that might influence the effects of robot-supported CT cultivation. Moderator analyses indicated that short-term (less than four weeks) robot-supported learning had a larger effect (g = 0.901) on CT practice than long-term (more than eleven weeks) learning (g = 0.309). This meta-analysis indicates that educators could apply robot-supported learning to cultivate students' CT and concludes with related implications.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has gained increasing recognition as a 21st-century competency. Although initiatives have been taken to define the term for educational practices, limited empirical evidence is available to clarify its underlying components, especially at the primary education level. This study aimed to identify the associations between CT and specific cognitive skills in the primary school context. Based on the literature, three cognitive domains were studied (i.e., mathematical, visuospatial, and reasoning skills) and standard test batteries were applied to a sample of 633 primary students (aged 7–12 years). Linear regression analyses were performed with CT performance as the dependent variable to investigate its associations with the measured cognitive skills, and demographic features (i.e., age, gender) and coding learning experience (i.e., years of coding experience, extra-curricular coding experience) were included as control variables. The results indicated that the students’ CT performance was significantly predicted by their attainments in numeracy, visual perception, spatial visualisation, and inductive reasoning, and the results remained significant after controlling for demographics and coding experience. The study adds to the literature by enriching the understanding of CT as a psychological construct and has practical implications for educational stakeholders regarding the importance of interdisciplinary teaching and the integration of specific cognitive skills into CT learning activities.

AB  - The sustainable and digital future of work may imply a dramatic equilibrium change between social factors and technological ones. We argue that providing suitable tools to support End-User Development (EUD) in the workplace could represent a way to cope with such future changes. The contributions of this paper include the analysis and characterization of the most used EUD techniques and their crossover with a new conveyed model of Computational Thinking. The synthesis between these aspects is made explicit in the construct of EUDability, which is designed to capture the quality dimensions of EUD systems suitable to work scenarios where better roles and better tools for individuals may be shaped. EUDability has to do with identifying and assessing the difficulties of EUD techniques on one side and the Computational Thinking skills held by individuals on the other side.

AB  - There has been an increasing interest in the integration of technology into language education. Meanwhile, computational thinking (CT) skills are fostered which influence communicative language teaching and learning. Despite CT's established importance in science education, its significance in language teaching remains scarce. This study contributes to knowledge synthesis and methodological development by reviewing 16 journal articles, analyzing CT applications in language learning across educational contexts, intervention tools, CT skills, language acquisition, and assessment methods. The results indicate that (a) more CT-involved activities are needed for primary, secondary, and tertiary education, (b) educational robots and Scratch stand out as the most trending intervention tools, (c) CT skills such as decomposition, abstraction, generalization and so on have a positive effect on students’ foreign language acquisition, especially in grammar and writing, (d) assessment of CT development can be surveyed through a validated and reliable instrument such as computer programming self-efficacy scale or an online platform: Dr. Scratch; Conversely, there is a diversity of evaluation tools in foreign language learning. This study is the first to review experimental research on integrating computational thinking into foreign language learning and offers significant implications for future research.

AB  - The development of programming skills and computational thinking in the formal educational context is one of the most recent horizons set by many educational systems worldwide. Although the first computational thinking initiatives are being applied from the earliest school ages, this research focuses on the secondary education level. Specifically, the objective is the following: to analyse the implementation of Arduino, as well as the benefits and opportunities it brings to secondary school students. For this purpose, documentary research has been undertaken applying a systematic review according to the PRISMA 2020 framework following the PiCoS strategy. Atlas.ti 9 was used to analyse the information. Out of 316 papers identified, 37 were included in the research. In relation to the results, Arduino is primarily used in technology and physics subjects, although it is also used to develop interdisciplinary STEAM projects. As a rule, it is used to learn programming languages, but likewise as a resource to develop science experiments. LED lights, servomotors and breadboards are among the most commonly used resources together with the Arduino board. and Scratch was the most widely used software. The initiatives implemented have yielded both positive and negative results, for example, one drawback is that some projects are very difficult, and some achievements such as: increased motivation towards the contents addressed or also the development of some soft skills, such as problem solving.

AB  - Recently, virtual reality (VR) technology has shown great potential in advancing education with many pedagogical benefits for building the 21st-century teaching and learning experience. This study conducted a formative evaluation of an immersive VR expedition application with the aim of understanding users' learning processes and how the application facilitates higher education students' computational thinking skills. Six participants were randomly selected to conduct this evaluation. A mixed research approach consisting of quantitative and qualitative methods was employed. The study quantitatively analyzed users' scores from gameplay to understand how the intervention supported computational thinking skills. Participants were also interviewed to collect data after playing the mini-games to investigate users' experiences. The study showcases players' computational thinking competency, assessed automatically during gameplay. Further, this study used inductive content analysis to demonstrate users' reactions to prototyped VR mini-games. The qualitative findings suggest that users found the VR mini-games interactive and immersive, which provided an opportunity to foster learners' computational thinking skills. The quantitative analysis revealed that student's computational thinking competency can be enhanced through consistent playing of the mini-games. Moreover, the expedition aspect of the VR game stimulated learners' curiosity, which sustained their learning progress. Furthermore, users gained new knowledge and found the mini-games educative. Nevertheless, several aspects of the VR mini-games need improvements, according to users' perceptions. This study contributes to the knowledge in terms of the affordances of VR in education research and provides relevant insights that can shape future studies, for example, the recent hype of metaverse in education.

AB  - Project-Based Learning (PBL) and Computational Thinking (CT), a teaching strategy and a problem-solving method, respectively, have been widely used in teaching and learning because of their educational advantages for students and teachers. However, studies of their integration into the teaching and learning process have been scarce, resulting in a lack of guidance for educators to implement such an approach that apply constructivism learning theory. This study aims to systematically review and identify appropriate frameworks, models, techniques and tools that could guide the successful implementation of PBL-CT. This study examined relevant articles published from 2017 to 2021 to highlight the gaps in the PBL-CT execution and map their backgrounds into a coherent taxonomy that could help guide the directions of future studies. As revealed, none of such articles explicitly explain any suitable PBL-CT frameworks or models. The study identified several common elements for the PBL-CT framework formulation, indicating scaffolding and inquiry are the most commonly applied techniques, with visual tools dominating the PBL-CT implementation. Most articles involved computing, followed by STEM, with a few originating from non-STEM fields. Several important implications could help educators develop an effective PBL-CT course design and provide some guidelines for future research. An effective PBL-CT integration enhances teaching and learning besides improving students' computational thinking skills. Thinking skills are critical 21st-century skills needed for students' success.

To effectively meet these curricular requirements, teachers themselves need a solid foundation of computational thinking content knowledge, which refers to the understanding and skills they possess in this area. However, despite widespread recognition of this need, few studies have rigorously examined teachers' content knowledge in this domain. Addressing this gap requires the development of high-quality measurement tools. This study details the development of an instrument, created as part of the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) 2023 in Flanders, to measure lower secondary school teachers' computational thinking content knowledge in a valid and reliable way. The article first outlines the construction process of the instrument, which involved close collaboration with experts in the field and drew upon the framework of Fraillon et al. (2023). Following this, the instrument's psychometric properties are presented, which include both item-level and overall instrument characteristics. These properties were evaluated using data from a sample of 352 participants, applying both Classical Test Theory and Item Response Theory. The final tool consists of sixteen multiple-choice and short constructed response questions. The results indicate favorable item and overall instrument characteristics, thereby affirming its potential to measure the intended construct in a valid and accurate way.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) skills help students both understand and utilize computing in various domains to cope with the challenges posed by the complex digital world. This study applied mind mapping to programming language instruction in a primary school, and explored the effects of mind mapping on students' CT skills when learning programming with Scratch as a programming tool. Two types of mind mapping, construct-by-self mind mapping (CBS-MM) and construct-on-scaffold mind mapping (COS-MM), were proposed to compare which type is more effective in terms of students' CT skills. Seventy-three public primary school fifth-grade students aged 10 to 11 participated in the study. The CBS group included 33 students learning with the CBS-MM instructional approach, while the COS group comprised 40 students learning with the COS-MM instructional approach. Data were obtained from nine topic Scratch programming assignments and pre- and post-CT skills surveys completed by the two groups. Paired sample t tests were used to analyze whether the two types of mind mapping approach could improve both groups' CT skills. One-way ANCOVA and one-way ANOVA were used to examine the difference in the two groups' CT skills. The results showed that both CBS-MM and COS-MM can improve students' CT skills; however, the COS group students could better improve their CT skills with the assistance of the COS-MM method compared with the CBS group students who learned with the CBS-MM method. The findings of this study can provide some enlightenment for relevant instructors to design instruction and implement programming teaching with different kinds of mind mapping support that facilitates students’ CT.

AB  - The specific mechanisms by which teachers and parents can provide culturally relevant opportunities for computational thinking for racially/ethnically and linguistically diverse groups of preschoolers remain unknown. Accordingly, the purpose of this research is to examine how PreK parent and teacher voice directed efforts to realize a culturally relevant computing program. We drew data sources from a subsample of design-based research meetings in which partners collaborated to co-develop the first iteration of the program. Using qualitative analysis, we examined how parent voice and teacher voice, conceptualized as perspectives and participation, influenced theories of culturally responsive computing and computational thinking in early childhood education and the translation of theory into practice in classroom and home settings. Findings showed that connecting powerful ideas from computational thinking, namely algorithms and problem solving (e.g., debugging), to familiar activities and experiences served as a powerful entry point. Yet, differences arose in how teachers and parents conceptualized culturally relevant computing and made connections to familiar routines. We discuss what can be learned from parent voice in regards to bolstering children's self-expression, access to increasingly complex computational thinking tasks, and opportunities for learning cultural and community values through computing.

AB  - In recent years, the development of computational thinking (CT) has become integral to many school curricula worldwide. This has been associated with calls for computational thinking to be considered a ‘21St Century’ competency, valuable to all students as a transferable process for solving problems and building understanding of human behaviour and systems. However, while computational thinking is a focus of most secondary school computer science curricula, proponents such as Jeanette Wing argue its relevance for younger students, indicating more work must be done investigating its development in early years' education. This study used a structured, problem-based curriculum supported by guided inquiry pedagogy, to explore 6 year old students' learning of basic computational thinking concepts and practices while coding programmable floor robots (Blue-bots and an iPad app). Results indicated improvement across the seven lessons in students' sequencing/algorithm authoring, error correction, and pattern recognition. Furthermore, they revealed evidence of higher order thinking such as identifying patterns in code, and how these can be transferred to help solve problems of different designs. While currently play-based approaches are used to introduce computational thinking concepts and practices in early years' education, results from this study suggest that more structured, problem-based methods should be seriously considered. Results challenge commonly understood developmental theories about what young children can and can't do, contextualised within the field of computer science, and hold implications for early years' teachers' professional knowledge and pedagogy if they are to promote their students' learning in this increasingly important area. Given rapid technological advancements such as artificial intelligence (AI) and increasingly earlier exposure of young children to digitally-mediated information, this study provides support for the earlier and more systematic introduction of basic digital literacy knowledge and skills in early years' education.

AB  - We conducted a systematic review of empirical studies aimed at exploring robot-mediated activities to promote the development of computational thinking in preschoolers. In this study, we investigated the robots used, proposed activities, and evaluation processes. We also analyzed research contexts and the stated motivations to conduct the studies. Our review identified characteristics of the robots, such as input and output interfaces, cost, and availability. We also categorized activities considering context, modality of work, type of activities, duration, adults’ role, scaffolding, unplugged activities, explicit debugging, communication and sharing instances, and teaching knowledge from other domains. We analyzed the computational thinking evaluation process looking at types of assessments, asset concepts, and research design. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of existing research, identifies existing gaps, and provides recommendations for future studies.

AB  - The integration of computational thinking (CT) into K-12 education offers substantial potential to improve digital literacy and deepen students’ understanding across various subject areas. By embedding computational procedures and solution-oriented approaches into traditional curricula, students can develop essential skills that are critical for thriving in an increasingly digital world. However, the effective integration of CT into subject-specific learning poses challenges for educators, largely due to a lack of training and experience in implementing interdisciplinary instructional strategies. This study explores the impact of integrating CT into K-12 education through diverse instructional approaches, including modelling, storytelling, and unplugged activities. The research examines how students' subject knowledge, CT concepts, and practices evolved under each CT integration practice, as well as their acceptance toward CT integrated lessons. The study was conducted in different subjects, including language arts, biology, and physics, and at different grade levels. The technology acceptance model was used as a theoretical framework to understand students' adoption towards the different integration practices. The study revealed that different CT integration practices yield varying impacts on students' attitudes, particularly in relation to their prior programming experiences. Namely, primary school students with prior programming experience display a higher behavioural intention due to a lack of early biases toward programming. Conversely, secondary school students, less familiar with interdisciplinary approaches, initially show less enthusiasm for future engagement. These insights underscore the need for tailored instructional strategies that consider students' prior experiences and the broader goal of preparing them to contribute to a technologically driven society.

AB  - As we begin to identify essential skills for the future, there has been an increased focus on how to define and implement computational thinking within education. However, the question of how to engage children with coding activities within the context and limitations of the curriculum remains relatively explored. In our study, a human-centered design approach was followed to guide a small group of children through the co-design, implementation and evaluation of a board game. The board game had two versions: an offline version involving a robotic agent and an online version with its digital equivalent. A mixed-method approach was used to understand and compare levels of engagement, usability, and collaboration in both versions of the game. The tangible aspect of working with a robotic agent in the offline version led to greater levels of motivation and involvement with the game mechanics. Tangible robotics games tend to be more approachable for children. Our study shows that using such games by connecting the mathematics curriculum with coding problems can successfully engage participants in collaborative computational thinking activities. We contribute to the field by providing human-centered guidance for the creation of educational tools to develop computational thinking. Such guidance is not only applicable in technologically rich environments; it can also be applied in educational communities with limited access to technology.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has been relevant in teaching STEM courses, and educators are incorporating both plugged and unplugged CT activities in their modules to prepare new entrants for advanced knowledge. However, additional empirical data are needed to understand how an unplugged activities approach can lead to an improved understanding of CT concepts. Therefore, this study investigates the impact of unplugged activities on novice students' CT skills and unravels the characteristics of students' CT competency from performing unplugged activities. The experimental aspect of this study was conducted with a cohort of 210 students participating in an introductory programming course at a University in Nigeria. A mixed-method research approach and a quasi-experimental design were applied in this study to understand how the unplugged approach in teaching CT could help students improve their CT competency. A paired-sample t-test of familiarity score for each CT concept showed a significant increase in the score before and after the intervention. Furthermore, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was used for topic modeling of the text describing students’ solutions. Topic modeling allows for more insights into the steps taken by the students to solve CT problems. Only 27.62 % of students' solution descriptions contained CT concepts, 56.90 % of the students solved the puzzle with an optimal score, and 72.41 % of students who applied CT concepts of problem abstraction and decomposition were able to solve the puzzle correctly. Indeed, CT unplugged activities significantly increased the number of students who gained CT competency. In addition, this study provides recommendation for computer science educators and highlight future direction.

AB  - Computational thinking is a fundamental competence that is being introduced in K-12 and succeeding curricula worldwide. Despite this huge effort, many computational thinking models in the literature do not explicitly take into consideration the pupils’ age and the developmental nature of computational thinking skills. Furthermore, many existing computational thinking models are focused on the internal thinking processes of the individuals, failing to explicitly consider the situated nature, in terms of social context and artefactual environment, that usually characterise tasks that require computational thinking to be solved. In this paper, we present a framework for the design, realisation, analysis, and assessment of computational thinking activities, called CT-cube. The CT-cube allows to extend existing computational thinking models to consider the life-long development of computational thinking skills in individuals, from childhood to adult age, and to take into consideration the situated nature of computational thinking activities. We use the CT-cube to design an unplugged task, called Cross Array Task (CAT), allowing to assess the algorithmic skills of K-12 pupils and we show how the CT-cube can be used in this case to illustrate the development of this competence along the entire compulsory school path, considering a sample of 109 pupil aged 3 to 16 in Switzerland.

AB  - The current single teaching and assessing modes of English as a foreign language (EFL) grammar in China have caused the disconnect between grammar knowledge and competency with numerous errors in essay writing, somehow ignoring the analysis of learners thinking patterns. To solve the problem, computational thinking (CT), a higher-order thinking in solving problems and optimizing the way to acquire knowledge, was employed in the study. As needed, the experimental group was taught using the CT teaching model following CT principal elements (data analysis, pattern recognition, abstraction, decomposition, and parallelization), while the control group followed the traditional teaching mode. Quantitative and qualitative data were obtained based on the pre-test-post-test, classroom observation, and questionnaire survey. The results show that the grammar application in short essay writing of all the members of the experimental group significantly improved and that higher grammar learning agency and engagement were unfolded to show the changes of thinking patterns. However, not all the members from the control group showed similar results. CT serves as an important social mediation tool in EFL teaching. This study further enriches the teaching modes of grammar and is an effective attempt at introducing CT into learners’ thinking patterns.

AB  - With growing interest in supporting the development of computational thinking (CT) in early childhood, there is also need for new assessments that serve multiple purposes and uses. In particular, there is a need to understand the design of formative assessments that can be used during classroom instruction to provide feedback to teachers and children in real-time. In this paper, we report on an empirical study and advance a new unit of observational analysis for formative assessment that we call an indicator of a knowledge refinement opportunity or as a shorthand, KRO indicators. We put forth a new framework for conceptualizing the design of formative assessments that builds on the Evidence Centered Design framework but centers identification and analysis of indicators of knowledge refinement opportunities. We illustrate a number of key indicators through empirical examples drawn from video recordings of Kindergarten classroom lessons.

AB  - Interest in coding education has exploded in the past five years, especially in elementary and early secondary education. Teachers who are largely new to coding are expected to guide entire student bodies through the fundamentals of coding and computational thinking. But little is known about which coding and computational thinking (CT) concepts teachers feel most comfortable with and which concepts they struggle with. This study describes 127 elementary coding teachers’ changes in their beliefs about teaching coding and CT as they participated in year-long continuous professional development. Novice elementary coding teachers demonstrated most growth in their self-efficacy for teaching sequences, algorithms and loops. They were less secure in their knowledge of conditionals, variables, and functions. For computational thinking, teachers were most confident in their ability to identify patterns, think algorithmically, understand logic, and evaluate outcomes, showing less growth with decomposition and abstraction.

AB  - This study compares the effects of coding education with educational robot and unplugged coding activities on pre-school students' computational thinking and executive function skills. This study used a pre-test and post-test comparison group quasi-experimental design. The study was conducted in a public kindergarten with 48 pre-school students (24 educational robot- BeeBot® group and 24-unplugged coding group) aged 5-6. The TechCheck-K test was used to measure computational thinking skills, and Executive Functions Battery-Computerized Touch was used to measure executive function skills. The process started with pre-test applications and ended with post-tests after four weeks (16 different sessions) of the implementation in both groups. The study found a statistically significant difference between the computational thinking pre-test and post-test scores of pre-school students in both groups in favor of the post-test. It was determined that there was a statistically significant difference in favor of the educational robot group between the post-test scores of computational thinking skills. In addition, when the findings regarding executive functions were evaluated, there was a statistically significant difference between the pre-test and post-test scores of total executive function in favor of the post-test in both groups. However, it was observed that there was no statistically significant difference between the post-test scores of both groups in terms of total executive function skills scores. In addition, when the post-test scores of pre-school students in two groups were evaluated, it was determined that there was no significant difference in computational thinking and executive function skills according to gender. Consequently, it was determined that coding education with an educational robot was more effective for gaining computational thinking skills than unplugged coding activities for pre-school students. However, it was observed that there was no difference between the two groups in terms of the development of executive function skills in pre-school education.

AB  - Since environmental and energy issues and challenges continues to emerge as key global concerns, Green Building Certification Systems are becoming increasingly relevant in the construction industry. In this regard, LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is considered one of the most widely recognized environmental assessment methods used globally in the construction industry today. However, due to the high level of complexity of the LEED system, the tools usually used to verify the achievement of the credits lack of “design friendliness” and hardly communicate effectively with the conventional tools used by architects and engineers (e.g. CAD, BIM). This makes difficult to fully take into account, especially at the early design stage, the many interconnected aspects that contribute to the green certification, with consequent issues often arising in the design validation and/or construction phases, resulting in time delays and cost increments. The application of innovative problem-solving methods, such as computational thinking, together with coding techniques, represents an effective way to deal with this issue. This kind of methodology, in fact, allows the requirements of a specific LEED credit to be digitally parametrised and flexibly incorporated into a “designer friendly” working environment. In particular, Visual Programming Languages (VPLs), due to their high simplicity of usage, allow architects and engineers to develop algorithms and thus implement their technical knowledge in the field of environmental design with computer programming skills, useful to improve their tools and keep them constantly updated. The aim of this paper is to illustrate a methodology through which, by merging computational thinking strategies with VPL tools, is possible to keep under control, in the same working environment, all the parameters required to verify in real time the achievement of LEED credits. To demonstrate the flexibility of the approach, dedicated tools developed for the verification of some specific credits at different scales – neighbourhood and building – are illustrated as operational examples of the proposed methodology.

AB  - Computational thinking, defined by Wing (2011) as the “thought processes involved in formulating problems … so that the solutions are represented in a form that can effectively be carried out by an information-processing agent,” has become the central construct of K12 computing education around the world. This article provides a history of computational thinking, a summary of computational thinking's role in educational policy and practice, role as a research construct, and concludes by considering the future of computational thinking. The debate over how to define and teach computational thinking can be understood as a proxy for the broader questions about education.

AB  - Collecting and organizing data to understand and answer real-world questions is an increasingly important skill in our current world. Fostering data collection and analysis (DCA) skills in young children leverages key mathematics skills as well as the data representation, visualization, and interpretation skills of computational thinking (CT), culminating in a problem-solving approach with data. As such, the intervention, comprising investigations and a digital app, supported preschool teachers and children to answer data-focused questions by engaging in each step of the DCA process in order to foster CT and math skills. Teachers appreciated that the app offers a new way for children to visualize data and noted that the app provided learning opportunities for children that would not otherwise be possible or easy to implement. Results also suggest that the app provides a systematic process for data collection, entry, and interpretation. Children in classrooms that completed the intervention had significantly higher scores at post-intervention compared to children in classrooms that did not complete the intervention, controlling for pre-intervention scores, B(SE) = 0.13(0.05), t (6) = 2.48, p = .048.

AB  - Computational Thinking (CT), the conceptual foundations required for solving complex problems effectively and efficiently, is an imperative skill for today's learners, across disciplines and across ages. As for its importance in the wide network of digital literacies, CT has been implemented in various educational contexts, however mostly via digital artifacts, specifically in programming-related activities. This approach does not fulfill the potential of such integration for promoting learning. In this paper, we argue that digital literacies should not be bound to the digital realm, and present a novel approach to fully integrate CT into learning and teaching by the development of CT-infused “unplugged” pedagogical tools that are fully embedded in the subject matter. We demonstrate the advantages to student learning of these tools in two case studies from K-12 mathematics education: 1) An assistive tool for function investigation in high-school calculus – in this case, we point out to how CT skills that were implemented in the tool promoted students' problem solving; 2) A teaching unit for pattern sequences in elementary school – in this case, we show how students in the CT research group outperformed students in the other groups, and how they implemented CT to solve pattern sequence problems effectively and efficiently. We highlight that besides enhancing learning, this approach can help address the important issue of equity in education, and suggest ways to promote it via dedicated professional development.

AB  - Creativity and Computational Thinking (CT) have been pointed out as two important skills that would promote students in the digital age as contributing members of society. Therefore, these two constructs have been extensively researched in recent years, but the associations between them are yet to be fully understood. This study takes another step towards bridging this gap by examining the association between CT and three types of creativity, i.e., Figural Creative Thinking, Verbal Creative Thinking, and Computational Creativity. Data was collected from 119 ninth-grade students (14–15 years old) from Israel. Students took two commonly used creativity tests (Torrance's Test of Creative Thinking, and the Alternative Uses Test). They also used Kodetu—an online learning environment for CT—and we used the system log files to measure their CT acquirement and their computational creativity. Findings suggest some nuanced associations between the four sets of variables. Specifically, we point out the limited associations between verbal and figural creativities, some of which are negative; also, we found that the associations between creative thinking and CT, as well as between creative thinking and computational creativity, differ by gender.

AB  - Many studies have demonstrated that Virtual Exchange (VE) for teaching languages can have a positive effect on learners' intercultural awareness or achievements. However, during this century, the teaching process has shifted from teaching with technology to solving problems with it. In this regard, pedagogical experts in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) have developed programming and robotics based on Computational Thinking skills (CTs), which have been regarded as the core of 21st-century skills. In the field of CALL, this skill has received very little attention. Accordingly, we have attempted to switch the process and outcome of language learning in VE. Thus, we developed the conceptual framework that integrated CTsCALL and Individual-technology-task-environment Fit (ITTEF). Having designed our VE tasks based on CTsCALL, we provided the opportunity for 92 Spanish language learners in our project to exchange language and culture with Cypriot and Irish students and solve VE tasks based on CTsCALL. The result of the symmetric phase of the study validated the five-dimensional structure of CTsCALL and the four-dimensional structures of ITTEF in VE and CALL. It also revealed that language learners, who focused on the key information rather than the details while solving language tasks, as well as recognizing the pattern of task solving and applying them to other tasks, found VE, and CTsCALL to be aligned with their current capabilities, learning environment, and problem-solving skills that mediated their intention to learn and exchange information in this context in the future. Furthermore, the asymmetrical part of the study revealed that sixteen solutions are available to shape language learners' continued intention to use VE by combining the components of CTsCALL and ITTEF. Thus, the study developed the CTsCALL questionnaire and its theory into CALL together with the Council of Europe's Common European Framework of Reference for Languages and recommended that CALL researchers and educators take a broader view of VE, as well as continuing to validate CTsCALL in other CALL disciplines to show that this skill belongs to CALL as well.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is gaining increasing attention from researchers and practitioners all over the world to empower children in the digital era. However, there is no consensus on which components of CT to teach beginning coders in early childhood education (ECE). To address this issue, we conducted a systematic review of 42 empirical studies focused on teaching and assessing CT in ECE. We analyzed the included studies with the three-dimensional CT framework proposed by Brennan and Resnick (2012) and demonstrated how this framework could be modified to fit the context of ECE. Based on this systematic review, we sorted out the CT components that were proven suitable for young children to learn by incorporating emerging components and removing components inappropriate for young children. We thus proposed a CT curriculum framework for ECE that covers CT concepts (i.e., control flow/structures, representation, and hardware/software), CT practices (i.e., algorithmic design, pattern recognition, abstraction, debugging, decomposition, iteration, and generalizing), and CT perspectives (i.e., expressing and creating, connecting, perseverance, and choices of conduct). This systematic review and its associated CT curriculum framework provide important theoretical contributions and practical implications for early childhood CT education.

AB  - In this paper, we review and meta-analyze the findings of experimental studies published between 2006 and 2022 that examined the effects of coding and programming interventions on children's core and higher order executive functions (response inhibition, working memory, cognitive flexibility, planning and problem solving). The systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to address three research questions: 1) Which executive functions are most impacted by the teaching of CT? 2) Which instructional modality (educational robotics/virtual coding/unplugged coding) is most effective in enhancing executive function skills in learners aged 4–16 years? and 3) Does the cognitive effectiveness of coding vary with children's age? A total of 19 studies with 1523 participants met the selection criteria for the systematic review. The meta-analysis included 11 of those studies. The results reveal beneficial effects of structured virtual and tangible coding (educational robotics) activities for preschoolers and first graders, and significant effects of more unstructured virtual coding activities (e.g., Scratch-based) for older students. A multivariate fixed-effects model meta-analysis shows that the teaching of coding significantly improves problem-solving with the highest effect (dppc2 = 0.89), but also planning (dppc2 = 0.36), and inhibition and working memory with lower effects (dppc2 = 0.17, dppc2 = 0.20).

AB  - In light of the increasing importance digital economy, the significance of computational thinking has grown exponentially, becoming imperative in both workplace and academic settings such as universities. This article addresses the critical need to comprehend the factors influencing the acceptance of computational thinking. The dataset introduces an extensive questionnaire comprising five constructs and 25 items, rooted in the extended Technology Acceptance Model. Notably, the model incorporates facilitating conditions and subjective norm, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding acceptance. Data collection involved 132 undergraduate university students sampled through purposive sampling, specifically targeting courses with a focus on computational thinking. The resulting dataset serves as a valuable resource for future research, offering detailed insights into the factors determining the acceptance of technology in educational contexts beyond mere thinking skills. Given the scarcity of research on technology acceptance in developing nations, this dataset holds particular significance, serving as a foundation for potential cross-cultural comparisons. The dataset contributes to the field by presenting a robust acceptance model, explaining 74.2 per cent of the variance in behavioural intention, 60.2 per cent in perceived usefulness, and 56.1 per cent in perceived ease of use. This high explanatory power positions the dataset as a superior resource for replication, benchmarking, and broader applicability in diverse contexts, thereby enhancing the understanding of computational thinking acceptance across different populations and settings. This dataset stands among the pioneering efforts to assess the novel covariance-based structural equation model algorithm within SmartPLS 4, presenting a valuable resource for future research employing the same mechanism.

AB  - This paper describes a study designed to investigate the promise of resources that support the development of computational thinking (CT) in preschool children. This study was the culmination of a collaborative research process between researchers and media developers of a home-based intervention that included media and hands-on activities created to support the development of young children's CT. The mixed-methods study included 108 families, each with a 4- or 5-year-old child. Families, who participated in the study at home for six weeks, were randomly assigned to an intervention group that viewed media and engaged with hands-on activities with a CT focus or a control group that viewed and engaged with non-STEM literacy content. Data collection consisted of parent surveys, parent interviews, and CT learning and pre-coding tasks to assess children's CT abilities. Results indicate that the learning intervention demonstrates promise in supporting parental understanding of CT. Experience with the intervention over the six weeks also appeared to cultivate some CT strategy use in children as evidenced by parental reports and performance on learning and pre-coding sequencing tasks.

AB  - This study characterizes the literature on teaching computational thinking (CT) to preschoolers aged 4 to 5 years. Previous research and published systematic studies have provided important contributions about CT teaching to elementary and high school children. However, to date, there is no systematic overview of CT education for preschoolers. For this reason, this systematic mapping synthesizes 82 studies on CT teaching, through the implementation and evaluation of tools and activities to teach, improve or measure the CT knowledge acquired by children. Furthermore, studies on courses or training offered to preschool teachers related to the teaching of CT were also considered. From the selected studies, the following information was collected: year of publication; recovery sources and databases; vehicles and places of publication; temporal delimitation of research, research approach, nature and research method; CT teaching approaches; tools used to teach CT and how they are classified according to their physical characteristics and, finally, participants and individuals responsible for the research. The results suggest an increase in the number of publications in recent years, revealing the interest of researchers in the topic. Furthermore, we observed a trend towards the use of physical artifacts and the use of the disconnected computing approach to teaching CT skills to preschool children. The results also exposed that preschool teachers have little autonomy in implementing CT teaching activities because those are mostly implemented by computer professionals (researchers, teachers, etc.). This is because preschool teachers are still discouraged from teaching computer and technology-related content to children, considering them complex and disconnected from basic curricula. However, when teachers are trained to teach CT, they become interested in the content and become more active during the teaching process. We argue for integrating CT-related content into education curricula and supporting preschool teachers to implement it autonomously in their classrooms.

AB  - This paper deals within a context where technology plays a pivotal role in education. In this sense, it is essential to highlight the emergence of new competencies and skills in education due to technological advancements. Legislative frameworks have been developed to incorporate digital literacy, access to robotics, and computational thinking, between others. Hence, this review and meta-analysis aim at identifying the influence of robotics activities on computational thinking through a PRISMA-guided review. The findings reveal that interventions conducted in early childhood education significantly impact computational thinking. Results also showcase that, despite perceived barriers related to technology accessibility, the presence of legislation and contexts prioritizing these competencies is more relevant than the digital access gap.

AB  - Since computational thinking is a high-level cognitive skill and its conceptual framework has not yet been clarified, the assessment of this skill is problematic. While there is no consensus in the literature about the components of computational thinking, the abstraction component is located at a point where opinions intersect. In addition, it is predicted that computer science unplugged activities will improve computational thinking, and there is limited research examining this effect. As a result, this research aims to demonstrate the alleged effects of computer science unplugged activities on abstraction skill which is considered the critical component of computational thinking. The study, which was planned with a mixed methods research design, lasted 8 weeks. Quantitative data were obtained from the abstraction skill test developed by the researchers, while qualitative data were obtained from observations and task- based interviews after each activity. Quantitative findings showed that computer science unplugged activities significantly improve abstraction skills and thus computational thinking. Qualitative findings not only revealed that developments in the six abstracting steps caused this significant difference but also identified abstracting steps where the effect of each activity was limited. Suggestions for organizing activities to improve these steps are given. Finally, suggestions are presented for the conceptual framework of computational thinking based on abstraction.

AB  - The healthy development of cognitive functions, including executive functions, has been shown to depend mainly on the experiences and learning opportunities of people, especially during childhood. Over the past few years, researchers have been studying the impacts of diverse types of interventions on children’s cognitive development in which computational thinking programs are a recent field. This pilot study evaluated the effect of computational thinking training based on the “Programming for Children” program on the executive functions of children aged 10 and 11 years: working memory, inhibition, and planning (N = 30). The results showed that children in the experimental group improved on tests of visuospatial working memory, cognitive inhibition, and sequential planning compared with the control group. However, tests of verbal working memory, memory strategy, and visual spatial planning did not show any observed changes. Although this was an exploratory study, and its findings should be interpreted cautiously due to the small sample size, the findings support the relevance and feasibility of conducting similar larger studies with larger samples.

AB  - Computational thinking has been promoted as an impactful 21st-century skillset that can be transferred to many other disciplines and problem scenarios. With the proliferation of age-appropriate coding platforms for young children, computational thinking has become increasingly popular in early childhood settings. However, there is a lack of research on introducing coding and computational thinking to teacher training in early childhood education. To empower early childhood teachers in the digital society, this study introduced 17 early childhood teachers to robot programming and computational thinking through the ‘CT4ECE’ professional development program, which includes three phases: Learn, Practice, and Reflect & Improve. Results of pre- and post-intervention surveys revealed that the CT4ECE program significantly enhanced teachers' robotics and pedagogical knowledge, as well as their attitudes towards computational thinking, especially their interest in and their view of using computational thinking in classroom practice. Post-intervention interviews indicated that participation in CT4ECE helped educators gain a basic understanding of both coding robots and computational thinking suitable for young children due to a structured change process for teachers' professional learning. This study establishes a strong foundation for enhancing and expanding the CT4ECE program, ultimately equipping teachers and children with the necessary skillsets to thrive in the digital future.

AB  - The purpose of the current study is to investigate the effects of the unplugged computational thinking (CT) integrated STEM (UCT-STEM) approach and STEM approach on early childhood pre-service teachers’ CT skills (creativity, algorithmic thinking, critical thinking, problem solving, cooperativity, communication). The study was conducted with a total of 70 early childhood pre-service teachers. Quasi-experimental design was used; activities based on the UCT-STEM approach were administered to the experimental group and activities based on the STEM approach were administered to the control group. Post-test scores for CT skills showed a statistically significant difference in favour of the experimental group. It was concluded that the UCT-STEM approach was more effective in developing the pre-service teachers’ CT skills than the STEM approach. The current study presents an important finding to the literature in terms of the developed STEM and UCT-STEM contents and how these contents improve pre-service teachers’ CT skills. The STEM and UCT-STEM content provides significant information in terms of teacher practices. At the same time, this study offers important implications for program developers and policy-makers to integrate these innovative educational approaches into both early childhood education and teacher education programs.

AB  - The integration of computational thinking (CT) to enhance creativity in design students has often been underexplored in design education. While design thinking has traditionally been the cornerstone of university design pedagogy and remains essential, the increasing role of digital tools and artificial intelligence in modern design practices presents new opportunities for innovation. By introducing CT alongside design thinking, students can expand their creative toolkit and engage with emerging technologies more effectively. Although many design students may have limited experience with programming, incorporating accessible, no-code tools can help them confidently embrace computational methods, unlocking new pathways for creative exploration and innovation. This study proposes an alternative approach to improve the motivation of design students by introducing machine learning tools into product design processes. We developed an experimental pedagogy in which 56 industrial design university students learned how to use Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (Weka), a machine learning tool, for three hours of design work a week, for a total of eight weeks. Our covariate analysis of data collected in the pretest and posttest shows that the general learning motivations in the group using Weka are significantly higher than those in the group without Weka. However, no significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of learning strategies, collaboration, or critical thinking. Students using Weka spent more time focusing on model training and tended to improve their algorithmic thinking, and the introduction of Weka appeared to enhance their motivation to learn. On the other hand, these students might have been focusing on working individually at their computers, potentially neglecting communication and collaboration. The findings suggest that teaching machine learning applications without requiring coding has the potential to boost design students' motivation to engage with CT skills, though care must be taken to maintain collaborative practices.

AB  - There is increasing effort to integrate Computational Thinking (CT) curricula across all education levels. Therefore, research on CT assessment has lately progressed towards developing and validating reliable CT assessment tools, which are crucial for evaluating students' potential learning progress and thus the effectiveness of suggested curricular programs. Several CT assessment tools were developed for elementary, high-school, and university students over the last years. Moreover, associations between CT scores and other cognitive abilities were unraveled. However, studies on the topic in primary school level are scarce. Like the general concept of intelligence, CT remains broadly defined as the ability to combine algorithmic operations to form complex solutions in order to solve problems effectively, utilizing concepts of computer science with or without the use of computers. In this study, we aimed at specifying a cognitive definition of CT, focusing on the under-investigated population of primary school children. Since validated assessment tools for this age group were not available, we adapted a validated CT test, which was initially designed for middle school students. In our study participated 192 third and fourth graders. The analyses revealed promising results on the reliability of the adapted CT assessment for primary school students. Moreover, findings indicated CT's positive associations with i. complex numerical abilities, ii. verbal reasoning abilities, and iii. non-verbal visuospatial abilities. Our results indicate similarities but also differences in associations of CT with other cognitive abilities in primary school children compared to other age groups. In summary: i. numerical abilities seem to associate with CT at the primary school level, whereas this seems not the case later on in education, ii. verbal abilities seem to associate with CT both along primary and secondary education levels, and iii. non-verbal reasoning abilities seem to associate with CT from primary education level to the university level and beyond. These differences imply that several basic cognitive abilities support CT abilities and CT development differentially across ages.

AB  - The concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI), born as the possibility of simulating the human brain's learning capabilities, quickly evolves into one of the educational technology concepts that provide tools for students to better themselves in a plethora of areas. Unlike the previous educational technology iterations, which are limited to instrumental use for providing platforms to build learning applications, AI has proposed a unique education laboratory by enabling students to explore an instrument that functions as a dynamic system of computational concepts. However, the extent of the implications of AI adaptation in modern education is yet to be explored. Motivated to fill the literature gap and to consider the emerging significance of AI in education, this paper aims to analyze the possible intertwined relationship between students’ intrinsic motivation for learning Artificial Intelligence during the COVID-19 pandemic; the relationship between students’ computational thinking and understanding of AI concepts; and the underlying dynamic relation, if existing, between AI and computational thinking building efforts. To investigate the mentioned relationships, the present empirical study employs mediation analysis based upon collected 137 survey data from Universidad Politécnica de Madrid students in the Institute for Educational Science and the School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering during the first quarter of 2022. Findings show that intrinsic motivation mediates the relationship between perceived Artificial Intelligence learning and computational thinking. Also, the research indicates that intrinsic motivation has a significant relationship with computational thinking and perceived Artificial Intelligence learning.

AB  - Computational thinking is widely recognized as an essential skill for adapting to the current era, with programming learning being the most effective means to develop it. It is recommended that computational thinking and learning programming be introduced as early as elementary school. However, elementary school students often possess limited prior knowledge of programming, posing challenges in their learning process. The graphic organizers (GOs) may serve as a bridge between students’ existing knowledge and new learning, facilitating a deeper processing of the overall information and thereby enhancing the learning process. This can be particularly advantageous for early-stage learners when grappling with difficult subjects. Consequently, this study employed GOs to assist elementary school students in their computational thinking and programming learning, employing a quasi-experiment design to evaluate their effectiveness. The results showed that although all students demonstrated awareness of applying computational thinking to solve problems, those exposed to GO-based instruction exhibited higher levels of computational thinking, programming skills, and flow experiences.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) practices is a critical cognitive tool for students to overcome challenges in this technological era. Few studies investigated CT practices from a development perspective. A two-year intervention was implemented in 30 intervention and 22 control schools in Hong Kong to promote CT education (T1baseline: N = 13,056; T2: N = 16,367; and T3: N = 15,269). Senior primary students (grades 4 to 6) around 8–12 years old were targeted. Among them, 34% were girls at T1baseline. Their learning progression of cognitive development was assessed with a CT practices test. Data were analyzed using item response analysis. Learning trajectories of CT practices were modeled to understand how students’ cognitive development differed between schools. Insights of findings were discussed in bringing CT practices to life.

AB  - Engagement is critical to computational thinking and programming education. However, as multi-dimensional variables, when analyzing how different aspects of engagement in computational thinking tasks influence skills development, it becomes crucial to discern precisely which engagement components intersect with the progression of computational thinking skills. This discernment is pivotal because engagement can vary based on the task nature, the context, and the individual's preferences. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the gender differences in engagement and computational thinking skills and the predictive relationships among these sub-dimensions for boys and girls in an unplugged environment. In this study, a quasi-experiment for 90 sixth-grade students from a north Chinese primary school was performed. By partial least squares–structural equation modeling, students’ models of computational thinking skills and engagement were analyzed, and comparisons of boys and girls were made by analysis of covariance statistics. Results indicated that compared with boys, girls reported higher computational thinking performance and more engagement in unplugged contexts. Furthermore, girls’ computational thinking skills were only predicted by their cognitive engagement, whereas boys’ computational thinking skills were predicted by their behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement. Teachers can adopt these findings to design computational thinking teaching interventions that combine the advantages of unplugged activity and focus on the engagement of boys and girls.

AB  - In this work, we argue for expanding the scope of K-12 computational thinking (CT) integration contexts to include everyday scenarios involving moral reasoning. Epistemic overlap between computational thinking practices and moral reasoning suggest that these contexts are potentially rich sites to see “seeds of CT” in children's reasoning and can provide rich educational pathways for children into CT. Taking a case-study approach, we examine the reasoning of a second-grader, Ollie, on a task involving fair allocation of resources to victims of a natural disaster. Our analysis finds that Ollie's reasoning was rich with seeds of CT (e.g., problem formulation, abstraction, complex-systems thinking) and that empathy served as an important supporting role to the CT. This work has implications for curricular design, suggesting that fairness and resource allocation scenarios with built-in opportunities for empathy might provide rich sandboxes for CT integration.

AB  - Although there are different definitions for computational thinking in the literature, it is possible to define it mainly as problem solving, designing and interpreting new systems by thinking like a computer. According to Wing (2006), computational thinking is a way of designing a system and understanding human behaviors by focusing on the basic concepts of the computer sciences. The recent focus on computational thinking as a key 21 st century skill for all students has led to a number of curriculum initiatives to embed it in K-12 classrooms and to introduce computing ideas to students early during their schooling years. The present study aims to explore the effects of a short, intensive coding and robotics training on the computational thinking skill self-efficacy of middle school students. 24 fifth graders participated in the study and data were collected by means of the Computational Thinking Self-efficacy scale (CTS) and one open-ended question. Analyses of the pre, post and delayed tests revealed significant differences between the pre and post-tests.

AB  - Methodological innovations across social sciences are opening new avenues for conducting research designed to address real-world challenges. The benefits of utilizing the Design-Based Implementation Research (DBIR) approach in public libraries to resolve a persistent problem of practice, a lack of assessment tools to evaluate youth Computational Thinking (CT) programs, is demonstrated. Findings from a three-year, three-phased study utilizing the DBIR approach to design and implement a suite of assessment tools to assess CT programming in public libraries are presented. Guided by the four principles of the DBIR approach, this research produced new knowledge, including identifying CT program outcomes, challenges, and recommendations for designing and implementing assessment tools to measure the impact of public libraries' CT programming. Findings underscore the DBIR approach as a strategy for engaging with practitioners and helping shift their perspectives by resolving practice problems and facilitating the design of sustainable solutions.

AB  - Although there is controversy surrounding rewards and competition in education, they are key elements in digital game-based learning (DGBL). Research on the influence of rewards and competition in DGBL often yields mixed results, suggesting a need to investigate individual game elements and their interactions. This study implemented DGBL focusing on computational thinking (CT) in 7th-grade classes. Both quantitative and behavioral data were collected to understand the impact of rewards (power-up or customization) and competition (with or without) on students’ intrinsic motivation, game performance, behaviors, and CT skills. The findings uncovered significant interactions between rewards and competition. Students with both competition and power-up rewards achieved the highest game points but the lowest CT performance, whereas those exposed to the same power-up rewards without competition attained the lowest game points but the best CT performance. Implications are drawn for DGBL research and practice.

AB  - Despite growing interest in early childhood computational thinking (CT), there is a lack of validated assessments for children who are emerging readers. This paper presents validity and reliability evidence of a performance-based assessment of CT using item response theory (IRT) from 272 children aged 4–8. Using a two-parameter logistic model IRT model (2PL IRT), we confirmed that model- and item-level fits are acceptable. Item analyses revealed a high discriminability (M = 2.26, SD = 1.12) and a moderate item difficulty (M = −0.21; SD = 0.86), on average, across 19 items. Reliability analysis demonstrated that the assessment was substantially reliable (marginal reliability: rxx = 0.87). Differential item functioning (DIF) analyses indicated that the assessment estimated children's item parameters fairly, regardless of their gender and age. However, we confirmed gaps in latent ability (θ) of CT by gender and age: boys showed higher latent ability of CT than girls, and old children (above 72 months) showed higher latent ability than young children (below 72 months). Findings suggest the assessment is a fair measure that can serve as a reliable and valid tool to assess CT for children who are emerging readers.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is an important and essential skill for human beings to master in the 21st century. Although CT has received wide attention since this concept was proposed, the current theoretical models have not well defined the complex relations between CT and other cognitive abilities for young children. To provide insight into this gap, the current study proposed a model in which we hypothesized that CT was significantly related to arithmetic fluency that is viewed as an important domain of mathematics. Additionally, arithmetic fluency was predicted to mediate the relations of CT to other cognitive abilities, including reasoning and creativity. This study tested such direct and indirect relations in children aged 5–6 years. Consistent with previous studies on older age groups, the results showed that CT and arithmetic fluency were significantly related to each other and both were significantly related to reasoning ability and creative thinking as well. Moreover, this study, for the first time, indicated that arithmetic fluency totally mediated the relation between CT and reasoning ability, suggesting that these concepts share conceptual commonalities, such as the cognitive processes related to mathematics or/and abstraction; in contrast, arithmetic fluency did not mediate the relation between CT and creative thinking, suggesting that gaining CT skill may exert direct positive effect on the development of creativity. Therefore, despite the root in computer science, CT is associated with many cognitive and learning abilities in other domains, supporting the importance of including CT into early school education.

Learning games offer the potential for innovative, stealth assessments of students' implicit learning from gameplay behaviors. This paper reports on the measurement of implicit CT practices demonstrated by upper elementary- and middle-school students as they play the CT learning game Zoombinis. The process of using the gameplay log data to build valid automated detectors of students' implicit CT practices is discussed. Findings from this study provide implications for analyzing gameplay behaviors at scale, leading to the development of models for the assessment of implicit STEM learning.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is critical for Twenty-first century life. Ensuring equitable access to CT depends on preparing teachers to integrate CT into disciplinary curricula. We report on the design, evaluation, and outcomes of the Computational Thinking Unplugged for Science (CT-UP-S) professional development program for inservice science teachers. Our process-based approach to CT significantly improved teachers CT understanding and CT/science integration self-efficacy by systematically linking CT practices to scaffold the generation of unplugged algorithms. Additionally, we found that the process-based approach provided a framework for teachers' lesson planning and that teachers’ content knowledge moderated their ability to write CT-integrated science lessons.

AB  - Early evidence suggests that robot programming offers an important foundation for spatial reasoning and computational thinking; however, researchers have debated how to introduce young children to these skills. We explored how preschoolers develop understanding of spatial concepts and computational thinking as the children took turns navigating a path during guided play with a programmable robot. Our analysis of the data included a multimodal visualization of the exchanges between the teacher, children, and a programmable robotic device. The findings highlight the effects that arose from the physical-digital convergence of technology integrated into play including: (a) the robot evoked a chain of actions, enacting pedagogic forces that transformed children's learning; (b) children used their own bodies as spatial referents, co-locating themselves in space with the robot; (c) the teacher remained a key actor, providing verbal and nonverbal scaffolding to promote children's understanding and mastery of spatial and computational concepts; and (d) talking with the teacher about spatial concepts combined with the interactions with the robot enhanced children's acquisition of spatial ideas relative to the quantity of children's verbal expressions and complexity of their applied spatial skills and computational thinking.

AB  - Workers in the areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics play a significant role in the sustained growth and stability of the global economy, and, thus constitute a critical component in helping all countries worldwide to prosper. In this context, computational thinking constitutes an important skill to have as it enables workers to develop creative solutions to complex problems. Nonetheless, across all economies worldwide, there is a need to have more workers who are able to think through problems, challenges, and solutions in computational terms. It is thus of utmost importance to integrate the teaching of computational thinking in K-12 education in order to reduce the skills gap between education and the workplace. A pertinent and crucial question that arises is whether teachers have the knowledge and skills to teach students how to think computationally. Existing research shows that teacher education departments do not currently have the knowledge to promote computational thinking in their programs. The present study focuses on two aspects of computational thinking, such as, algorithmic thinking and debugging skills with the use of scaffolded programming scripts in an educational technology undergraduate course. The results show statistically significant learning gains in pre-service teachers’ algorithmic thinking and debugging skills in the context of robotic programming activities with LEGO WeDo. Limitations and future research directions are discussed.

AB  - Recent studies identify Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) as a key factor in enhancing cognitive development, particularly within Computational Thinking (CT) literature. However, research gaps remain in understanding how SRL and CT interact from a developmental perspective. Our study designed a program with tailored animations and worksheets to specifically foster students' learning and cognitive development. Using a mixed-methods approach, we administered surveys among 1235 students from 29 Hong Kong primary schools to investigate a dynamic learning system comprising SRL and CT in a large-scale CT program. Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 students to further probe insights. Quantitative findings revealed a mutually reinforcing relationship in the dynamic system, suggesting that higher SRL skills enhance cognitive CT abilities, and vice versa. Complementing these results, qualitative findings showed that integrating animations and worksheets into the CT program significantly boosted students' SRL and cognitive development. These findings have significant implications for educational practices and curriculum design. Schools should consider implementing SRL strategies, such as proactive goal setting and reflective evaluation, within their curricula to promote students’ cognitive development. Furthermore, strategic investments in educational technology, including collaborations with EdTech developers, are essential to create effective, pedagogically sound tools that enhance learning outcomes. These insights provide valuable guidance for creating a supportive SRL environment that fosters cognitive development in primary school education.

AB  - In recent years, there has been increasing interest in integrating Computational Thinking (CT) into elementary schools. However, few studies have focused on teachers’ perceptions. This study aims to examine teachers' perceptions to bridge the gap between theory and practice. The study analysed teachers’ perceptions of integrating CT into school subjects through the constructionist approach, using Scratch a leading programming platform inspired by Resnick's Lifelong Kindergarten Constructionist model. Over a school year, 31 teachers participated in a professional development program and applied this model in their classrooms. The teachers were interviewed to capture their perceptions of learning and teaching using a constructionist method. The findings revealed that teachers with creative arts experience fully embraced the model, while others partially adopted it. Teachers recognized the benefits of constructionist teaching in fostering creativity, motivation, and engagement among students. However, they struggled with balancing these benefits with school demands and constraints. Challenges included managing time effectively within constraints of school and ensuring curriculum alignment. Despite this, many teachers found that the constructionist approach positively impacted students' learning engagement and personal development. By addressing the identified challenges, teacher education designers, curriculum developers, and schools can develop practices for closing the gap between theory and practice.

AB  - Educational research on predicting learners’ computer programming performance has yielded practical implications that guide task designs in computer education. There have been attempts to investigate learners’ computer programming patterns using high-frequency and automated data collection. This approach can be considered as process-based analysis as opposed to outcome-based analysis (i.e., the use of test or exam scores). In this process-based approach to investigate learners’ computer programming process, we included two critical constructs in our research, self-regulated learning and computational thinking skills. We aimed to identify learners’ computer programming patterns in the context that novice students learn a computer programming language, Python, in an online coding environment. We examined the relationships between the learners’ coding patterns, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills. Initially, we adopted a traditional approach with the aggregate data of learners’ computer programming behaviors. We then utilized a computational analytics approach to learner performance, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills, with ever-changing computer programming patterns. In our initial approach, the indicators of aggregate computer programming data were not associated with learners' learning performance and computational thinking skills. In the computational analysis approach, many indicators revealed significant differences between the identified patterns regarding computational thinking skills and self-regulated learning. Recommendations about the use of programming log data analysis methods and future scaffolding for computer programming learners are addressed.

AB  - In the field of education, research has consistently emphasized mathematical creative thinking as a crucial component of 21st-century skills. Thus, this cross-sectional study examines the predictors of such thinking by specifically focusing on the roles of perceived creativity, creative self-efficacy, and computational thinking. The participants consisted of 896 secondary school students (52.9 % female; 47.1 % male) in Indonesia who were asked to complete a series of online questionnaires and tests. For analysis, structural equation modeling was employed, demonstrating satisfactory construct validity and instrument reliability. Based on the results, there was a positive association between computational thinking and mathematical creative thinking. In addition, perceived creativity had a positive impact on mathematical creative thinking, whereas creative self-efficacy showed a negative association. As for the empirical model, it revealed that computational thinking plays a mediating role, connecting perceived creativity and creative self-efficacy to mathematical creative thinking. The findings suggest that incorporating these skills and related variables into the mathematics curriculums in schools is essential for preparing students for success in the 21st century.

AB  - Previous studies have explored the relationship between computational thinking (CT) and creativity. However, a consensus has yet to be reached since both CT and creativity varied in ideation and assessment. To uncover the cognitive mechanism underlying the interplay between CT and creativity, we conduct a scoping review of 26 empirical studies published in 2006–2024. Our findings suggested that the effects of working memory varied in the interplay between CT and creativity due to differences in age range, neural network activation regions, and measurements. Intellectual abilities, including algorithmic fluency, reasoning ability, and coding ability, showed cognitive transfer effect on CT skills but not necessarily on creativity, suggesting that cognitive abilities embracing more intelligent elements may contribute to the functional connectivity in CT neural networks but only partly overlapped with creativity involved networks. Although executive functions (working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control) play a crucial role in both CT and creativity, their contributions to the CT-creativity interplay are still rarely studied. Future research should explore the CT-creativity relationship from the perspective of neuroscience.

AB  - This systematic review examined how computer science (CS) education was implemented in schools and its efficacy for developing students’ computational thinking (CT). Sixty-six papers were selected for this systematic review and analyzed for patterns in relation to the implementation of CS education in K-12 schools and its impact on the development of students’ CT skills. Although educational interventions have not always been successful in CS education, this review provides strong evidence that overall, CS education promotes the development of students’ CT in the K-12 setting while improving their creative and critical thinking skills. We recommend early access to CS education, various innovative instructional approaches to CS education and appropriate support and guidance for student learning.

AB  - Recently, the development of computational thinking (CT) skills has become widespread in the whole world. There is a consensus to develop students’ CT skills through unplugged and plugged-in programming. However, the choice of programming approaches taught in schools is arbitrary and few studies have compared the effectiveness differences between unplugged and plugged-in programming. This study aimed to explore the differences between unplugged and plugged-in programming in developing CT skills of students in Grades 1-2 students. It also explored the joint effects of students’ gender, programming experience, programming interest, and programming confidence with different programming approaches on CT skills. The quasi-experimental research approach was used to conduct 10 weeks of unplugged, plugged-in, and regular programming activities with 124 Grades 1-2 students. The results found that unplugged programming promoted CT skills more in the early primary grades than plugged-in programming. We found that boys and students with programming experience in unplugged group performed significantly better in CT skills than in plugged-in group. Moreover, the improvement of CT skills of students in unplugged group was positively correlated with the level of their programming interest and programming confidence. However, these were not observed in plugged-in group. The results of this study can provide precise guidance for teaching CT skills to early primary school students and provide references for CT education.

AB  - This paper presents an investigation that compares and analyzes the interactions of three groups of pre-and-primary school children with three different storytelling systems. We identify emerging patterns through which they engaged in what we refer to as narrative computational thinking. The latter describes broadened aspects of narrative literacy practices that are linked to computational thinking. By applying a multicase study approach and through various vignettes, we illustrate how children applied computational thinking to understand and influence the narrative possibilities offered by the different tools. Our results illustrate circumstances under which digital storytelling activities provide a favorable basis for narrative computational thinking, and that when computational thinking functions as a scaffold for story creation, it encourages a blend of creativity and computational thinking, providing a compelling approach to introducing emerging digital literacies to young children in a narrative context.

AB  - In this study, it is aimed to identify the computational thinking skills used by gifted and talented students in integrated STEM activities based on the EDP. The case study design, a qualitative research method, is employed in the study. The participants consist of gifted and talented students attending the Science and Arts Center. Integrated STEM activities based on the EDP were conducted over the course of ten weeks and among these activities, robotic and 3D modeling-based robot construction activities using Lego sets are addressed in the present study. The STEM activity booklet, researchers' fieldnotes, and teaching process video recordings were used as data collection tools in the study. Data that was collected was analyzed through content analysis. It was seen that gifted and talented students participating in integrated STEM activities based on the EDP make active use of critical thinking skills while providing explanations, making associations, questioning information, giving justifications, solving problems, thinking creatively, making generalizations, and attempting to convince others; as for the instances of defining problems, creating solutions, and evaluating the effectiveness of the solution, the students were observed to actively use their problem-solving skills. The detailed account provided by the study on the way robotic and 3D robot modeling activities improve the computational thinking skills of gifted and talented students contributes to the required educational support and to the existing body of literature.

AB  - In the artificial intelligence age, cultivating young children's computational thinking (CT) has sparked tremendous attention. Programmable robotics is a developmental-appropriate and screen-free means that provides young children with great opportunities to learn programming and develop CT. However, it is reported that young children might have difficulties learning abstract CT concepts. As a helpful pedagogical facilitator, metaphors can help turn abstract concepts into more concrete and clear concepts that learners are familiar with. Therefore, this research proposed a metaphor-based robot programming (MRP) approach and explored its impact on young children's CT and behavioral patterns. A total of 118 children aged 5–6 were recruited in this experiment with two conditions: the experimental group adopted the metaphor-based robot programming (MRP) approach while the control group used the conventional robot programming (CRP) approach. Results revealed that children who adopted the MRP approach outperformed children who adopted the CRP approach on CT. In addition, behavioral analysis indicated that the proposed MRP approach could facilitate children's superior learning performance and more positive learning behaviors, so as to help them achieve learning objectives. Accordingly, this study can provide insightful guidance and inspiration for future research on effective programming teaching and CT development for young children.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is a necessary skill for students. It is as important as the other essential skills such as reading, writing, and arithmetic. However, how to improve students’ CT in robotics is still to be explored. Hence, this study examined the effects of computer supported project-based learning (CSPBL) on students’ CT and learning engagement through comparing students’ CT and engagement in two courses instructed by the same instructor (one instructed with a traditional method, the other instructed with CSPBL). Participants were seventy-nine students from a university in China. Questionnaires, interviews, and project analysis were used to measure students’ CT and learning engagement. The comparative results of self-reports and final projects indicated that the CSPBL enhanced students’ CT. The simulation project training based on the SenseStudy learning platform in CSPBL helped students debug the programming code, optimize the algorithm design, and improve their algorithmic thinking, cooperation, and problem solving during the program error correction. The CSPBL also improved students’ engagement in learning, especially for those with more than one year of programming experience. It was found that the CSPBL was effective in terms of improving students’ CT and engagement in robotics learning. This study provides teachers with practical suggestions to conduct effective robotics instruction.

AB  - Malaysia has introduced computational thinking skills as part of a curriculum integration update to meet the global trends in 21st-century education, focusing on empowering digital literacy. Nevertheless, a preliminary investigation revealed an apparent lack of understanding of computational thinking skills in general among teachers. The study explores the feasibility of developing a localized E-learning system to train computational thinking skills among teachers. An E-learning system, termed as myCTGWBL, was developed on the basis of a newly proposed conceptual framework to present computational thinking teaching–learning repertoire to the teachers. The hypothesis is that myCTGWBL would develop teachers' computational thinking and its position in teaching–learning understanding. myCTGWBL relevance was tested through DeLone and McLean's information system and Urbach's collaboration quality construct. To determine the success factors, partial least squares structural equation modeling was used. A total of 369 teachers participated in a two-stage survey. Participants' understanding of computational thinking and perceptions were recorded at the pre- and post-intervention phases. Open-ended questions of the surveys were analyzed using a simple text analysis technique. The closed-ended questions surveys were analyzed using SPSS Statistics 22.0. A significant improvement in teachers' computational thinking teaching–learning repertoire in a relatively short period has been recorded. Teachers also demonstrated increased confidence in the future delivering computational thinking-based lessons. The E-learning conceptual framework has illustrated the predictive power between user intent, user satisfaction, and Computational thinking (CT) knowledge benefits. Results demonstrate that myCTGWBL could be used to guide future planning when establishing CT knowledge acquisition initiatives, particularly among teachers.

AB  - Efforts to incorporate computational thinking (CT) into academic courses have been gaining popularity. CT is a problem-solving skill that is crucial in the 21st century. CT may be used to support language education. Courses in English as a foreign language often need an effective writing component that includes writing organization and language use, as demonstrated by the poor writing samples often generated by students of these courses. To address the problems, CT, which is a higher-order mode of problem-solving and knowledge acquisition optimization, was used. The experimental group was instructed using the CT teaching model based on CT's essential components (decomposition, generalization, abstraction, algorithm, and evaluation), whereas the control group was taught using the conventional method. In total, 58 undergraduate students divided into two groups participated in this study. A combination of writing, CT skills, surveys, and interviews were used to collect data according to an experimental design. The collected quantitative data were analyzed through analysis of covariance and structural equation modeling, and the MAXQDA 2022software was used to analyze the collected qualitative data. The results of this study indicate that incorporating CT into an English writing course enhances the writing and higher-order thinking skills of students. The CT concepts helps students develop critical thinking skills by evaluating the text and identifying potential issues or improvements. Additionally, it allows students to use their skills to create unique writing solutions, which can boost English writing creativity.

AB  - Computational thinking education has become an increasingly popular topic among practitioners and researchers. However, rare is known how to effectively teach and learn computational thinking in early childhood education. To address this knowledge gap, this systematic review examined 26 studies on the teaching and learning of computational thinking in early childhood education from 2010 to 2022. The content knowledge, tools, pedagogical design, assessment methods, and learning outcomes were analyzed. Results indicated that, with age-appropriate instructional design, children could develop early concepts and skills of computational thinking, as well as other related skills such as communication, collaboration, and problem solving. Across the studies, we found that most studies used quantitative research methods, with direct assessment and observation being the most. Several challenges were identified: (1) achieving a deeper learning of computational thinking; (2) a lack of valid and reliable computational thinking assessments for children with a wider age range; (3) selecting appropriate learning tools; and (4) designing age-appropriate activities for young learners. Although with these challenges, computational thinking education could bring new learning opportunities and enhance children's computational thinking skills, as well as other non-cognitive skills such as critical thinking, body-material interaction, and hand-eye coordination. This systematic review informs future endeavors in theorizing a digital learning framework that can integrate computational thinking into early childhood education.

AB  - Teacher competencies encompass the dimensions of knowledge and attitudes, yet few studies have analysed teachers' latent profiles in relation to the interaction between these two dimensions. Latent profile analysis, which examines the interplay between variables to distinguish subgroups of individuals, has recently emerged in studies of computational thinking (CT) as a method for identifying student profiles. However, the latent profiles of CT teachers have not yet been analysed. We therefore analysed the latent profiles of a sample of 493 teachers who had participated in a teacher development programme in CT, according to their knowledge and perceived usefulness of CT. Three profiles were identified: (1) highly knowledgeable with high perceived usefulness, (2) knowledgeable with low perceived usefulness, and (3) less knowledgeable with low perceived usefulness. Qualitative data further triangulated these findings. We also examined the learning achievement of 12,105 students taught by these teachers. Students taught by highly knowledgeable teachers with a high perceived sense of usefulness demonstrated significantly better achievement than their peers. Our findings highlight the importance of nurturing both knowledge of and perceived usefulness in CT. They also provide valuable insights for similar teacher development programmes, emphasizing the importance of peer mentoring support for less knowledgeable teachers. Additionally, we underscore the value of having teachers create artefacts using CT for instructional purposes, allowing them to gain firsthand experience of its usefulness. As few studies have explored teachers' latent profiles based on the dimensions of knowledge and attitudes, the contribution of this study extends beyond the domain of CT.

AB  - We designed a controlled trial protocol that seeks to contribute to cognitive science by studying the effect of thought training on children's executive functions. The study design is a cluster randomized controlled trial, with intra-subject and inter-subject evaluation, with two parallel groups: an experimental group and a TAU control group. With three measures, pre-test, post-test, and follow-up after three months. The participants will be children aged 9 to 11. The allocation will be randomized by groups and not individually. The sample will be a minimum of 44 participants. The primary measures will be neuropsychological tests to assess executive functions. Secondary measures will be a computational thinking test, neuropsychological tests to assess metacognition and attention, and an acceptability scale. The experimental group will participate in the COGNI-MACHINE computational thinking training designed by the first author. The training frequency will be twice a week in 60 min sessions for 12 weeks. The TAU control group will receive computer science classes as usual during the same time as the experimental group. The evaluators taking the measurements will be blinded to the assignment. The investigators in charge of the intervention will be blinded to the results of the evaluations.

AB  - Negative feedback can temporarily relieve negative Chinese transfer (NCT) in English as a foreign language (EFL) syntactic writing by focusing only on the surface writing constructs, neglecting that EFL writing is an embodiment of the process by which higher-order thinking operates. To solve the problem, the researchers conducted a pretest, interventionist group dynamic assessment (IGDA) in the form of negative feedback based on computational thinking (CT), higher-order thinking, and post-test quasi-experimental design, with a control group receiving the direct correction feedback instructing model to mitigate the NCT in EFL syntactic writing. We analyzed the syntactic writing types and frequencies of the NCT obtained through repeated-measure ANOVA and confirmed by qualitative data through video recording. The results indicated that IGDA in the form of negative feedback based on CT principal skills could (1) significantly decrease syntactic writing errors caused by the NCT, (2) improve learners’ EFL writing performance, and finally, (3) elevate the computer as an essential mediation tool. This innovative instructing mode of intervening with writing constructs and higher-order thinking and bringing about deeper thinking and creativity contributes to the EFL writing teaching methodology in a foreign language higher education.

AB  - The tenure system in the United States places significant importance on teaching effectiveness. To date, students' evaluations of teaching (SETs) have been the reigning mechanism for assessing effective teaching. However, prior work has shown that SETs are often biased against underrepresented groups and minorities. The present study analyzes options for effective teaching assessments, which include evaluating final grades and measuring the differences between students’ pre- and post-tests (normalized gain) using standard instruments. The content area and the instrument used in this study originated in the computational thinking field, which has a widespread presence in engineering, where minorities are at a disadvantage. This study obtained a total of 88 student participants from four sections of an introductory engineering course at a Southwestern institution. The study utilized a computational thinking diagnostic (CTD) to inform the course teaching approach (the intervention). Results show that (a) normalized learning gains correlated moderately with SETs, (b) final grades correlated strongly with SETs, (c) final grades correlated strongly with normalized learning gains, (d) the educational intervention based on the CTD significantly affected student learning, and (e) SET comments affect evaluations. The implications include the notion that standardized instrument-driven instruction and evaluations can increase the success of minorities on both sides of the classroom. The purpose of this manuscript is to invite the Heliyon readership to get involved in the development of related instruments and to incorporate these measures of learning into their instruction so biases are avoided or minimized.

AB  - In the digital age, our lives become more dependent on technology, yet the digital gap is intensifying especially because most people lack digital literacy. As a modest step to handle this challenge, we designed a course named "Play with me in Code" to develop pre-service teachers' (PSTs) thinking skills and expose them to learning by creation using computational thinking and programming as part of the constructionism paradigm. The added value of using Scratch in the context of teacher education lies not only in familiarity with a programming language but with an emphasis on experiencing self-directed learning tackling with problem solving situations, creativity, socioemotional competencies, and logical computational thinking. The present study aims to examine 25 PSTs' attitudes towards facing challenges of coding with Scratch. To this end, a mixed-method approach was activated by using questionnaires, blog posts, and reflections. Findings revealed that the learning environment encouraged PSTs' use of abstraction and decomposition to address a complex problem or to design a complex game. Study's conclusions relate to the importance of providing PSTs opportunities to experience learning by programming for raising their awareness of the importance of enhancing thinking skills and creativity in the future.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT), a way to think about solving problems, is recognized as a basic skill for the 21st century. Although game-based learning (GBL) has been shown to improve student's CT skills, students may fail to self-evaluate or debate as they play games, thus failing to develop higher-order thinking. Also not widely explored is how teachers are to practice the CT core competencies during the learning process to cultivate students' problem-solving thinking. As the adoption of student-generated questions (SGQ) is an instructional strategy to promote higher-order thinking, we develop a GBL platform that uses this strategy to enhance students' CT skills, learning motivation, and learning confidence. For this purpose, fifty-three primary school students were recruited for this study, and data were collected during four classes of experimental CT activities. This study shows that the experimental group using the SGQ strategy with a GBL platform exhibited significantly higher CT skills than the control group. In addition, with respect to learning motivation and learning confidence it is found that the experimental group also outperformed the control group. This confirms that integrating the SGQ strategy and CT core competencies fosters higher-order cognitive thinking in students in problem-solving through gamification of the learning environment, resulting in higher motivation and confidence to complete experimental activities.

AB  - Teacher preparation programs currently struggle to (a) address the challenges preparing students to use computing principles, and (b) do so in ways that apply a critical lens toward societal inequities. In this paper, we describe our (1) integrated STEM and computational thinking (CT) teacher preparation program; (2) response to barriers educators face in preparing students to critically use computing principles; and (3) examples of the pedagogical practices teacher candidates developed through the program. We contribute an approach to preparing and empowering educators to support students understanding and use of CT as a lens for advocating for social justice in their lives.

AB  - To effectively utilize artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies such as ChatGPT and realize their novel ethical issues, individuals must have a variety of knowledge and skills about AI. Such knowledge and skills have led to the emergence of AI literacy. Despite the importance of AI literacy in everyday life, little is known about its determinants. To better understand the determinants of AI literacy, we attempted to build a research model relying on previous research and different theoretical frameworks. The model incorporated digital divide, cognitive absorption, and computational thinking. As a major finding from the current study, computational thinking was found to be a significant determinant of AI literacy, which facilitate using, recognizing, and evaluating AI-based technologies. Moreover, we found out that individuals with physical access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) are more expected to use and recognize AI. Also, motivation and skills in using ICTs enable individuals to better evaluate the outcomes of AI-based technologies. The findings also showed that convenient access to ICTs contributes to a deep involvement with AI-based technologies in the use. Further, individuals with higher motivation and skills to use AI technologies are likely to have a pleasant experience after using these technologies.

AB  - Both computational thinking (CT) and creativity have been recognized as key skills for today's learners. Over the last decade, research of both skills in a single context has emerged. In this paper, we present a scoping review of 62 such empirical from 2011 to 2020. Our goal was to have a thorough understanding of the educational settings in which research on both CT and creativity was conducted, the theoretical foundations it has laid down, and the research tools used. Our findings indicate a geographical bias (dominance of the US and prominence of developed European countries), as well as a focus on secondary education and on STEM-related disciplines; this could be explained by the current situation of CT spread. We also found that when studying CT and creativity jointly, it is most common to define CT in a broader perspective than merely programming of computer science. Additionally, while creativity is largely referred to as product-related, CT is barely referred to as such. Taken together, our findings point out some gaps in the current research of CT and creativity and suggest how it should be expended on the fertile grounds of creativity, as the latter crosses geographical, age, and subject borders. Doing so may build a bridge between CT and creativity in a way that will benefit both.

AB  - This paper sheds light on 3–5-year-old children’s enactments of computational empowerment (CE) in activities with computational thinking (CT). CT is widely elaborated on as a universal problem-solving approach and a skill set necessary for thriving in today’s digitized societies. Scholars claim that CT for all should be ensured from an early age, and several studies develop and examine age-appropriate technological tools, as well as pedagogical approaches, for young children’s learning of CT. Based on 1.5 years of co-designing for children’s situated CT in two Danish kindergartens, the present study conducts a socioculturally informed analysis of video-observed interactions between children and educational robots. The findings display how children and robots engage in interactions that transcend children’s mastery of CT in any narrow sense. This is examined as situated enactments of CE; as children’s critical and informed decisions regarding the roles that technologies, in this case educational robots, can play in their institutionally situated social lives. The paper concludes that children’s various enactments of CE deserve scholarly and professional attention, both as an important prerequisite for, and as a necessary limitation to, the implementation of CT in kindergartens.

AB  - Since the end of the 20th century, the digitalization of society, including the educational systems, has been growing exponentially. At the same time, education systems have been evolving towards competency-based assessment. Likewise, at the beginning of this century, the idea of Computational Thinking was resurrected by J. Wing, for solving problems and designing systems using concepts of computer science. Today, we can see how all these questions are taking shape in a new competence, called Computational Thinking, related to others that already exist. In this paper, we have studied the skills of Computational Thinking in university students, focusing on abstraction and its possible relationship with other factors. Results conclude that the students fail in relation to abstraction and in algorithmic thinking. Although the ability of abstraction is not easy to measure, a linear regression analysis has been carried out in order to determine its possible study.

AB  - Teaching computational thinking (CT) has become a priority for educators and policymakers tasked with educating and training students for future jobs which are predicted to be increasingly automated. Recent research on effective instructional interventions for developing computational thinking skills, including algorithmic and critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity, and cooperativity, suggests that teaching and learning CT can improve student academic performance. In fact, the extant literature is quite sanguine about the topic of CT. However, few studies have attempted to establish a relationship between CT skills and academic performance. In the present cross-sectional study, we employ path analysis to model the structural relationship between self-reported CT skills and academic performance of a sample of 81 computer science undergraduates enrolled at a Southwestern American university. We found few direct relationships between CT skills and academic performance. We only find a significant positive relationship between creativity and academic performance and a significant negative relationship between cooperativity and academic performance. Our findings are surprising considering the abundant research promoting computational thinking as a key component of 21st century skills. The findings call for further in-depth analysis of computational thinking and the influence on students’ learning and learning outcomes. We discuss our results with respect to recent educational mandates for including CT and instructional alignment in school curricula. Our findings contribute to the existing discussion by helping to clarify the relationship between CT skills and academic performance in higher education.

AB  - Although studies have shown that computational thinking (CT) can enhance learning processes and outcomes across traditional subjects, they have not shown how teachers might scaffold children's CT processes in a technology-mediated learning context. This exploratory study examined how teacher talk and technologies impacted the CT of three children (6 to 8 years old). Seven videotaped 90-minute sessions of weekly project-based activities yielded 4,842 turns of talk (2,974 by children). Statistical discourse analysis revealed the following results. After a teacher command, the children more often executed a sequence of actions toward a solution but less often demonstrated problem understanding than otherwise. Following a teacher's open question, the children were more likely to offer logically organized ideas. In response to a teacher's rhetorical question, they more often searched for information. These results inform educators regarding when to use each type of teacher talk to scaffold children's CT processes.

AB  - ChatGPT (generative pre-trained transformer) is one of the artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that have started to be used in programming education. However, the effect of using ChatGPT in programming education on learning processes and outcomes is not yet known. This study investigated the effect of programming education using the ChatGPT on students' computational thinking skills, programming self-efficacy, and motivation toward the lesson. The research was conducted on 45 undergraduate students who took a university-level programming course. The research was carried out according to the experimental design with the pretest-posttest control group. Students were randomly divided into experimental (n = 21) and control (n = 24) groups. While the experimental group students benefited from the ChatGPT during the weekly programming practices, the control group students did not use this tool. Research data were obtained through the computational thinking scale, computer programming self-efficacy scale, and learning motivation in computer programming courses scale. Research findings revealed that the experimental group students' computational thinking skills, programming self-efficacy, and motivation for the lesson were significantly higher than the control group students. In line with this result, it can be said that it may be useful to benefit from AI technologies such as ChatGPT in programming trainings. The research findings, it was emphasized how the most effective use of AI support in the lessons could be made, and various suggestions were made for researchers and educators in this regard.

AB  - In this paper, we explore how the theoretical notion of possibility space offers a way to study how children's computational thinking develops as a process. Drawing on embodied notions of cognition, we first examine the literature that supports how children's computational thinking emerges as a possibility space that involves conceptualizing possible actions in a given moment, deciding which action to take by anticipating the results of a possible action, and learning from the actions that they have taken. We then use a grounded approach to analyze the problem-solving process of two 5th-grade children who engaged in an educational robotics activity over two 50-minute class periods. The findings lend support for approaching children's computational thinking as a cycle of action-taking that includes conceptualizing, anticipating, and taking action. The findings also support the pedagogical practice of having children predict the results of a computer program to enhance their computational thinking. Implications for the way that teachers can support children in learning to conceptualize what is possible and take action from it are discussed.

AB  - Predictive learner modelling is crucial for personalized education. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great success in education, their potential in learner modelling via image data is unexplored. This research introduces a novel and interpretable approach for Image-based Learner Modelling (ImageLM) using CNNs and transfer learning to model learners’ performance and accordingly classify their computational thinking solutions. The approach integrates Grad-CAM, enabling it to provide insights into its decision-making process. Findings show that our custom CNN outperforms other models (namely ResNet, VGG, and Inception), with 83% accuracy in predicting solution correctness. More importantly, the ImageLM approach identifies the regions that contribute the most to the predictions, shedding light on learners' computational thinking knowledge and advancing toward trustworthy AI for education. These results underline the potential of utilizing imagery data from learners’ activities during the learning process to predict their performance, especially in challenging environments like programming where traditional feature extraction and learning might struggle.

AB  - The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has led to the proliferation of computational thinking (CT) education. However, research on unplugged activities’ influence in elementary math classrooms is limited, despite some exploring programming's cognitive benefits. This study presents both qualitative and quantitative analyzes stemming from a ten-week quasi-experimental research endeavor, specifically tailored for third-grade students. The research devised a series of unplugged activities, encompassing mathematical games, hands-on construction of mathematical logic boards, and calculating shopping discounts. The overarching objective was to investigate the impact of these unplugged activities on students’ mathematical creativity and CT. Students participating in a mathematics curriculum based on unplugged activities (N = 47) were compared with students participating in a traditional lecture-based mathematics curriculum (N = 46). The results indicated that unplugged activities exhibited significant advantages in fostering students’ CT and mathematical creativity across three dimensions, namely, problem-posing creativity (t = 5.830, p < 0.01), problem-solving creativity (t = 6.633, p < 0.01), and creative self-efficacy (t = 7.554, p < 0.01). Furthermore, the study revealed a relationship between students’ mathematical creativity as a predictor of CT. The results of the quantitative analysis were supported by the teacher's and students’ interview data, and the students felt excited and interested in the unplugged activities, whereas some students using the lecture-based method reported boredom and lack of interactivity. This research offered valuable insights for mathematics and CT education practice, underscoring unplugged activity as an innovative instructional approach that brings forth new possibilities for traditional mathematics teaching, with potential applications in the K-12 curriculum.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has received worldwide attention due to its alignment with developing 21st century skills such as creativity, problem-solving, and digital competence. With the increasing provision of programming tools such as robotic toys and tablet apps in the sector of early childhood education (ECE), many ECE researchers and practitioners tend to link CT to programming. However, children are reluctant to sustain their interests in programming activities, and may be further demotivated by debugging failures. This multi-group quasi-experimental study aimed to evaluate the effects of a story-inspired approach in bridging the gap between programming and CT for preschool children. Building on previous literature suggesting storytelling as a powerful, culturally responsive pedagogy, 5-year-old children (N=108) were involved in nine weeks of CT learning via one of the three conditions: Story-Inspired Robot Programming (SIRP), Story-Inspired Tablet Programming (SITP), and unplugged CT education. Results revealed that children who participated in the SIRP and SITP conditions showed improved CT scores, relative to unplugged CT education, even after controlling for baseline CT scores. No gender or family socioeconomic effects were found to influence the benefits of story-inspired programming interventions. These findings suggest that storytelling as a culturally responsive approach, whether using robots or tablets as a programming tool, can provide young children with more inclusive and sustainable CT learning experiences.

AB  - Content area K-12 teachers are increasingly asked to integrate computing and computational thinking into their classrooms, yet they often have little experience with computing. The purpose of this study was to understand how science teachers, new to computing and integrating computational thinking into their classrooms, supported students as computational problem solvers. In the project from which this research was drawn, 8th grade science teachers in three US school districts integrated computer game design into their study of climate systems and climate change. We conducted participant observation, collected teacher implementation logs and interviewed 15 teachers engaged in the three-year design research project, Building Systems from Scratch. Analysis through grounded theory yielded several results related to teachers’ orientations, strategies, and use of resources to create systems of distributed expertise. We identified five major themes: a) releasing responsibility to students, b) co-learning with students, c) encouraging students’ independent problem solving, d) building interdependence among students, and e) providing multiple other resources. Findings are discussed in relation to the literature on integrating computational thinking into content area classrooms.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is currently used as an umbrella term in education to describe the processes associated with learning and applying computer science concepts and strategies for problem-solving. Despite a growing body of literature on the subject within education and the development of a grand variety of tools designed to enhance computational thinking abilities, the relations between CT and other cognitive abilities have not been reported in young children. Understanding CT from a cognitive development perspective could be useful for creating targeted interventions tailored for young children. In the present study, we compare a previously reported computational thinking assessment with a battery of nine cognitive tests, which include fluid intelligence, working memory, planning, sequencing, mental rotation, vocabulary, and early math precursors such as numerical transcoding and symbolic magnitude comparison. Mixed-effects linear regressions were implemented with CT as a dependent variable to explore the associations between our variables. A subsample of children who participated in an educational robotics intervention were assessed in their robot programming performance, and its outcomes were compared with their CT assessments. Results suggest temporal sequencing ability and symbolic magnitude comparison are significant predictors of CT in kindergarten. Positive significant associations between robot programming and CT performance are reported.

AB  - The research aims to evaluate the effect of a robotics-based computational thinking program on executive functions and visuospatial skills in preschool children. Additionally, the study will explore the relationship between these three variables and early experiences with toys. The study will be a cluster-randomized controlled trial with pre- and post-intervention measures. Participants will be preschool children aged 5 to 6 years from both public and private institutions. The intervention will involve a new educational robotics device called ROVERSA and will consist of eight sessions distributed over four weeks, with the experimental group placed on a waitlist. To assess executive functions and visuospatial skills, standardized and validated neuropsychological measures will be used, including the Flanker task, the NIH Toolbox Card Sorting Test, the Corsi Block Test, the NEPSY-II Mental Rotation Test, the Pyramid of Mexico from the ENI-2 battery, and the Computational Thinking Test (CTt). Data analysis will begin with a hypothesis tested through ANOVA-MR, and linear regressions will be implemented to assess the relationship between variables. It is expected that the results will contribute to the discussion on teaching computational thinking and educational robotics as early learning experiences and their impact on the cognitive development of children.

AB  - This study examined the impact of a 10-month STEM professional development (PD) program on 25 teachers working with gifted students. The program aimed to enhance pedagogical knowledge and competencies. Findings indicated significant positive improvements in teachers' STEM self-efficacy, computational thinking, and entrepreneurship skills. The PD program also had a direct positive influence on the quality of lesson plans. The study suggests that effective PD design should incorporate scientific inquiry, engineering design processes, computational thinking, entrepreneurship skills, and the development of teachers' self-efficacy for successful implementation of PD outcomes in STEM education.

AB  - Educators emphasize that computational thinking is especially helpful in raising problem-solving skills, improving logical reasoning, and developing analytical thinking. In this context, the aim of this study is to develop an online, interactive, valid, reliable and useful performance-based assessment tool for measuring computational thinking skills. Data were collected in two stages with three different measurement tools. In the data collection phase, a psychometric scale, a skill test and an interactive web application developed in this study were used. In the study in which a total of 203 high school students participated, it was determined that the students' computational thinking skills were at average level. as a result, a valid and reliable performance-based platform was developed for measuring computational thinking skills. It has also been concluded that the performance-based measurement tool makes a better measurement than the psychometric scale. It is emphasized that computational thinking should be treated as a skill or group of skills, not as a theoretical knowledge, product/portfolio or attitude/perception. Therefore, it is believed that developing performance-based tools for evaluating computational thinking skills and measuring them by using multiple measurement tools will give more accurate results. Considering the developments in computational thinking, it is thought that the study will contribute to the literature.

AB  - Computing education has progressively entered into children's early years. Due to a proliferation of computing education programs and coding tools designed for young children, research on the relationships between computational thinking (CT) and other domains of learning and development is highly warranted. Yet, there is little empirical evidence that shows the relationship between CT and children's overall cognitive functioning. As such, this study explored the relationships between Chinese children's CT and their sequencing ability and self-regulation in early childhood. One hundred and one Chinese young children (Ngirl = 52 and Nboy = 49; Mage = 5.25, SD = 0.73) were recruited and evaluated with three reliable instruments. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that: (1) CT positively predicted sequencing ability (β = 0.27, p < .05) even after controlling for relevant demographic covariates such as age, gender, and family socioeconomic status; (2) CT positively predicted self-regulation (β = 0.47, p < .001) after controlling for demographic covariates. Our findings suggest that CT may be a domain-general ability that is based on cognitive foundations that extend beyond the realm of computing.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is regarded as the conceptual basis required for identifying and solving real-world problems through algorithmic approaches to achieve transferable solutions. Developing students' CT in primary school stages is essential and has received considerable attention. Meanwhile, researchers incorporated digital badges into classrooms to improve students' learning motivation in computer science (CS). However, few solid empirical studies analyze the effects of the digital badges approach in CS education to develop students' CT. Therefore, to bridge this gap, this study designed and implemented a block-based programming course in a primary school and examined the impact of the digital badges approach on pupils' CT skills and self-efficacy and learning motivation in CS. A quasi-experimental design was conducted among 99 third-grade students across three classes. The results revealed that the adapted digital badges in primary school (1) significantly improved the students' CT skills, (2) had no significant positive impact on their CT self-efficacy or learning motivation in CS, and (3) showed no mediating effect of learning motivation on the relationship between CT skills and CT self-efficacy. In addition, we found that whether students could see only their own digital badges or also those of others had no impact on CT skills, self-efficacy, or learning motivation in CS. These findings have implications for the design of digital badge educational interventions intended to promote students' CT and learning motivation.

AB  - Computational thinking refers to a series of cognitive processes involved in solving problems through computational systems. A growing body of studies has managed to demonstrate the correlation between computational thinking and different cognitive domains. In recent decades, multiple studies have taken place that seek to evaluate the effect of computational thinking on higher-order cognitive processes. The current study aims to contribute to this discussion by analyzing the effect of an intervention program in computational thinking on the executive functions of school-age children. In this experimental study, 30 children aged 10 and 11 were randomly assigned to an experimental group and an active control group. The instruments to collect the data were 15 tests of the neuropsychological battery of executive functions and frontal lobes BANFE-2, which were applied to both groups before and after the intervention. The experimental group participated in an 8-week computational thinking intervention during which its participants enrolled in plugged and unplugged activities and carried out block programming language twice a week. The results showed that the intervention had significant effects on executive functions associated with the anterior prefrontal cortex and the dorsolateral cortex, but not those related to the orbitofrontal area.

AB  - Learning coding during early childhood is an effective way for children to practice computational thinking. Aspects of children's motivation can increase the likelihood that children approach computational thinking activities with enthusiasm and deep engagement. Gender inequities may interfere with children's readiness to take advantage of opportunities to build computational thinking skills through activities such as coding. Societal stereotypes can reduce young girls’ motivation to engage with computer science, preventing them from gaining benefits from coding activities designed to support computational thinking. This study examined children's gender stereotypes as well as children's own motivation for computer coding in 363 first- through third-grade children. We assessed gender differences in both stereotypes and motivation, as well as links between the stereotypes that individual children held and their own motivation. Children generally endorsed stereotypes about interest and ability for computer coding that favored their own-gender group, although third-grade girls reported gender-egalitarian beliefs about interest in coding. There were no gender differences in children's motivation for computer coding in terms of their own interest, sense of belonging, or ability self-concepts. Children's stereotypes about their own-gender group were significantly positively correlated with their own motivation for computer coding. These findings suggest that early childhood represents an excellent age for children to begin building computational thinking skills, before girls endorse negative stereotypes about their gender's interest in computer science.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is an essential skill students need if they are to adapt to the rise of digital society, and the evaluation of CT is crucial for enhancing students’ CT. However, the current evaluation of CT is based on a summative paradigm and ignores real CT performance during the assessment process. This study thus used a multimodal cognitive diagnostic model (H-MCDM) of students’ CT based on multimodal data in situational tasks, to achieve precise evaluation and explore the current mastery status of students’ CT and their cognitive and behavioral characteristics. The research results indicate that: 1) students’ CT was at a moderately high level and indicated a good grasp of the CT components of problem decomposition and algorithm design, but students had not yet mastered problem abstraction, 2) a total of six different CT latent patterns were discerned in the overall student results, 3) individual students who shared the same CT latent patterns could differ in their cognitive and behavioral characteristics, while those with different CT latent patterns could share similar characteristics. This study showed that it is possible to capture the degree of students’ mastery of CT and their cognitive and behavioral differences with the same or different CT latent patterns at a granular level, providing a basis for developing individualized strategies to enhance students’ CT.

AB  - In-service elementary school teachers need training to teach computational thinking (CT). A common model for CT professional learning programs includes an initial workshop followed by ongoing support. However, little research has examined the efficacy of ongoing support, the most effective types, and its impact on classroom practices. The current study details a multifaceted CT professional learning program with innovative ongoing support to help elementary school teachers implement the Code.org curriculum. It also empirically investigated the impact of the support on teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT, the effectiveness of each component of the support, and to what extent it affected teachers' classroom practices. Our ongoing support included an additional workshop, grade-level professional learning community (PLC) sessions, instructional videos, and teacher leaders' support. Data included a pre-survey, four post-surveys, lesson observations, a focus group interview, tracking the number of video views, and surveys from PLC participants and teacher leaders. Results indicated that the ongoing support significantly increased teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT. Regarding the effectiveness of the various components of the ongoing support, the additional workshop significantly increased teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT. Teachers valued each component of the support, and this support improved teachers’ classroom practices.

AB  - The present study investigates the debugging process of 526 children in preschool (4–6 aged) when programming a tangible robot. When a child is involved in programming, it is needed to identify and correct errors, or in other words, debug a program. Debugging is a high-level thinking skill and is an essential component closely related to developing Computational Thinking in early childhood education. Though the debugging process is a cognitive function in programming investigated by many researchers in recent decades, most studies are conducted either in primary, secondary education, or higher education concerning beginners or experts in programming. Very few reviews, and some focus on preschool education. Our study set out the following objectives: 1) How do children identify the existence of error and locate it? 2) What types of errors emerge when coding? 3) What type of error is complex for novice programmers? 4) What strategies are developed by novice programmers to debug effectively? and 5) What types of knowledge do novice programmers construct by debugging the tangible robot Bee-Bot? The study follows an iterative model of a design-based research approach. It uses multiple case studies to collect qualitative and quantitative data. The programming intervention was implemented by 30 educators in their classrooms and was based on a scenario-based teaching design. The debugging process was analysed using Klahr & Craven's framework (1988): 1) test and evaluate program, 2) identify bug, 3) represent program, 4) locate bug and 5) correct bug. The main finding is the construction and development of syntactic and semantic knowledge.

AB  - A plethora of programming platforms purports to teach preschool-aged children computational thinking (CT) and coding skills. However, the empirical evidence to support their effectiveness is still in its early stages. A three-week didactic intervention using ScratchJr was conducted to investigate its effectiveness in fostering CT and rudimentary coding skills in a cohort of preschool children (N = 34, aged 4–6 years). While the initial performance mean of the control group (M = 7.07, SD = 2.58) exhibits a statistically significant elevation t (22.64 = 2.23, p = 0.036) vis-à-vis the experimental group (M = 5.35, SD = 1.58), t (22.64) = 2.23, p = 0.0 the terminal performance means of both groups converge closely. However, meticulous data analysis unveils a statistically notable enhancement among preschool participants exposed to the educational intervention involving ScratchJr. Notably, both instructional modalities appear commensurate in nurturing elementary computational tenets, namely modularity and control structures. The experimental cohort outperforms the control group with statistical significance in comprehending potent ideational constructs encompassing representation, algorithms, and hardware/software interplay. Conversely, the control group performs better in grasping the debugging concept than their experimental counterparts. The outcomes lend substantive credence to the efficacy of the distinct programming milieu offered by ScratchJr, underscoring its effectiveness in cultivating CT and coding proficiencies within the preschool demographic.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is crucial for students. Robot-supported learning has emerged as a popular approach for CT cultivation. To understand the effects of robot-supported CT cultivation, the current study conducted a meta-analysis to analyze studies from Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Science Direct databases (2012–2022) which screened using keywords ``computational thinking'' and ``robot''. After further screening, 26 peer-reviewed articles were selected. We synthesized the 33 effect sizes to assess the overall effectiveness of robot-supported learning on CT and its sub-dimensions: concepts, practices, and perspectives. Our findings revealed a medium effect of robot-supported learning on students' CT (g = 0.643), a large effect on CT concepts (g = 0.650), a medium effect on CT practices (g = 0.587), and a huge effect on CT perspectives (g = 1.419). We also explored the moderators (i.e., grade level, study duration, culture, learning strategy, and assessment tool) that might influence the effects of robot-supported CT cultivation. Moderator analyses indicated that short-term (less than four weeks) robot-supported learning had a larger effect (g = 0.901) on CT practice than long-term (more than eleven weeks) learning (g = 0.309). This meta-analysis indicates that educators could apply robot-supported learning to cultivate students' CT and concludes with related implications.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has gained increasing recognition as a 21st-century competency. Although initiatives have been taken to define the term for educational practices, limited empirical evidence is available to clarify its underlying components, especially at the primary education level. This study aimed to identify the associations between CT and specific cognitive skills in the primary school context. Based on the literature, three cognitive domains were studied (i.e., mathematical, visuospatial, and reasoning skills) and standard test batteries were applied to a sample of 633 primary students (aged 7–12 years). Linear regression analyses were performed with CT performance as the dependent variable to investigate its associations with the measured cognitive skills, and demographic features (i.e., age, gender) and coding learning experience (i.e., years of coding experience, extra-curricular coding experience) were included as control variables. The results indicated that the students’ CT performance was significantly predicted by their attainments in numeracy, visual perception, spatial visualisation, and inductive reasoning, and the results remained significant after controlling for demographics and coding experience. The study adds to the literature by enriching the understanding of CT as a psychological construct and has practical implications for educational stakeholders regarding the importance of interdisciplinary teaching and the integration of specific cognitive skills into CT learning activities.

AB  - The sustainable and digital future of work may imply a dramatic equilibrium change between social factors and technological ones. We argue that providing suitable tools to support End-User Development (EUD) in the workplace could represent a way to cope with such future changes. The contributions of this paper include the analysis and characterization of the most used EUD techniques and their crossover with a new conveyed model of Computational Thinking. The synthesis between these aspects is made explicit in the construct of EUDability, which is designed to capture the quality dimensions of EUD systems suitable to work scenarios where better roles and better tools for individuals may be shaped. EUDability has to do with identifying and assessing the difficulties of EUD techniques on one side and the Computational Thinking skills held by individuals on the other side.

AB  - There has been an increasing interest in the integration of technology into language education. Meanwhile, computational thinking (CT) skills are fostered which influence communicative language teaching and learning. Despite CT's established importance in science education, its significance in language teaching remains scarce. This study contributes to knowledge synthesis and methodological development by reviewing 16 journal articles, analyzing CT applications in language learning across educational contexts, intervention tools, CT skills, language acquisition, and assessment methods. The results indicate that (a) more CT-involved activities are needed for primary, secondary, and tertiary education, (b) educational robots and Scratch stand out as the most trending intervention tools, (c) CT skills such as decomposition, abstraction, generalization and so on have a positive effect on students’ foreign language acquisition, especially in grammar and writing, (d) assessment of CT development can be surveyed through a validated and reliable instrument such as computer programming self-efficacy scale or an online platform: Dr. Scratch; Conversely, there is a diversity of evaluation tools in foreign language learning. This study is the first to review experimental research on integrating computational thinking into foreign language learning and offers significant implications for future research.

AB  - The development of programming skills and computational thinking in the formal educational context is one of the most recent horizons set by many educational systems worldwide. Although the first computational thinking initiatives are being applied from the earliest school ages, this research focuses on the secondary education level. Specifically, the objective is the following: to analyse the implementation of Arduino, as well as the benefits and opportunities it brings to secondary school students. For this purpose, documentary research has been undertaken applying a systematic review according to the PRISMA 2020 framework following the PiCoS strategy. Atlas.ti 9 was used to analyse the information. Out of 316 papers identified, 37 were included in the research. In relation to the results, Arduino is primarily used in technology and physics subjects, although it is also used to develop interdisciplinary STEAM projects. As a rule, it is used to learn programming languages, but likewise as a resource to develop science experiments. LED lights, servomotors and breadboards are among the most commonly used resources together with the Arduino board. and Scratch was the most widely used software. The initiatives implemented have yielded both positive and negative results, for example, one drawback is that some projects are very difficult, and some achievements such as: increased motivation towards the contents addressed or also the development of some soft skills, such as problem solving.

AB  - Recently, virtual reality (VR) technology has shown great potential in advancing education with many pedagogical benefits for building the 21st-century teaching and learning experience. This study conducted a formative evaluation of an immersive VR expedition application with the aim of understanding users' learning processes and how the application facilitates higher education students' computational thinking skills. Six participants were randomly selected to conduct this evaluation. A mixed research approach consisting of quantitative and qualitative methods was employed. The study quantitatively analyzed users' scores from gameplay to understand how the intervention supported computational thinking skills. Participants were also interviewed to collect data after playing the mini-games to investigate users' experiences. The study showcases players' computational thinking competency, assessed automatically during gameplay. Further, this study used inductive content analysis to demonstrate users' reactions to prototyped VR mini-games. The qualitative findings suggest that users found the VR mini-games interactive and immersive, which provided an opportunity to foster learners' computational thinking skills. The quantitative analysis revealed that student's computational thinking competency can be enhanced through consistent playing of the mini-games. Moreover, the expedition aspect of the VR game stimulated learners' curiosity, which sustained their learning progress. Furthermore, users gained new knowledge and found the mini-games educative. Nevertheless, several aspects of the VR mini-games need improvements, according to users' perceptions. This study contributes to the knowledge in terms of the affordances of VR in education research and provides relevant insights that can shape future studies, for example, the recent hype of metaverse in education.

AB  - Project-Based Learning (PBL) and Computational Thinking (CT), a teaching strategy and a problem-solving method, respectively, have been widely used in teaching and learning because of their educational advantages for students and teachers. However, studies of their integration into the teaching and learning process have been scarce, resulting in a lack of guidance for educators to implement such an approach that apply constructivism learning theory. This study aims to systematically review and identify appropriate frameworks, models, techniques and tools that could guide the successful implementation of PBL-CT. This study examined relevant articles published from 2017 to 2021 to highlight the gaps in the PBL-CT execution and map their backgrounds into a coherent taxonomy that could help guide the directions of future studies. As revealed, none of such articles explicitly explain any suitable PBL-CT frameworks or models. The study identified several common elements for the PBL-CT framework formulation, indicating scaffolding and inquiry are the most commonly applied techniques, with visual tools dominating the PBL-CT implementation. Most articles involved computing, followed by STEM, with a few originating from non-STEM fields. Several important implications could help educators develop an effective PBL-CT course design and provide some guidelines for future research. An effective PBL-CT integration enhances teaching and learning besides improving students' computational thinking skills. Thinking skills are critical 21st-century skills needed for students' success.

AB  - Computational thinking has become an integral component of curricula worldwide, necessitating teachers to develop this competence in their students. To effectively meet these curricular requirements, teachers themselves need a solid foundation of computational thinking content knowledge, which refers to the understanding and skills they possess in this area. However, despite widespread recognition of this need, few studies have rigorously examined teachers' content knowledge in this domain. Addressing this gap requires the development of high-quality measurement tools. This study details the development of an instrument, created as part of the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) 2023 in Flanders, to measure lower secondary school teachers' computational thinking content knowledge in a valid and reliable way. The article first outlines the construction process of the instrument, which involved close collaboration with experts in the field and drew upon the framework of Fraillon et al. (2023). Following this, the instrument's psychometric properties are presented, which include both item-level and overall instrument characteristics. These properties were evaluated using data from a sample of 352 participants, applying both Classical Test Theory and Item Response Theory. The final tool consists of sixteen multiple-choice and short constructed response questions. The results indicate favorable item and overall instrument characteristics, thereby affirming its potential to measure the intended construct in a valid and accurate way.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) skills help students both understand and utilize computing in various domains to cope with the challenges posed by the complex digital world. This study applied mind mapping to programming language instruction in a primary school, and explored the effects of mind mapping on students' CT skills when learning programming with Scratch as a programming tool. Two types of mind mapping, construct-by-self mind mapping (CBS-MM) and construct-on-scaffold mind mapping (COS-MM), were proposed to compare which type is more effective in terms of students' CT skills. Seventy-three public primary school fifth-grade students aged 10 to 11 participated in the study. The CBS group included 33 students learning with the CBS-MM instructional approach, while the COS group comprised 40 students learning with the COS-MM instructional approach. Data were obtained from nine topic Scratch programming assignments and pre- and post-CT skills surveys completed by the two groups. Paired sample t tests were used to analyze whether the two types of mind mapping approach could improve both groups' CT skills. One-way ANCOVA and one-way ANOVA were used to examine the difference in the two groups' CT skills. The results showed that both CBS-MM and COS-MM can improve students' CT skills; however, the COS group students could better improve their CT skills with the assistance of the COS-MM method compared with the CBS group students who learned with the CBS-MM method. The findings of this study can provide some enlightenment for relevant instructors to design instruction and implement programming teaching with different kinds of mind mapping support that facilitates students’ CT.

AB  - The specific mechanisms by which teachers and parents can provide culturally relevant opportunities for computational thinking for racially/ethnically and linguistically diverse groups of preschoolers remain unknown. Accordingly, the purpose of this research is to examine how PreK parent and teacher voice directed efforts to realize a culturally relevant computing program. We drew data sources from a subsample of design-based research meetings in which partners collaborated to co-develop the first iteration of the program. Using qualitative analysis, we examined how parent voice and teacher voice, conceptualized as perspectives and participation, influenced theories of culturally responsive computing and computational thinking in early childhood education and the translation of theory into practice in classroom and home settings. Findings showed that connecting powerful ideas from computational thinking, namely algorithms and problem solving (e.g., debugging), to familiar activities and experiences served as a powerful entry point. Yet, differences arose in how teachers and parents conceptualized culturally relevant computing and made connections to familiar routines. We discuss what can be learned from parent voice in regards to bolstering children's self-expression, access to increasingly complex computational thinking tasks, and opportunities for learning cultural and community values through computing.

AB  - In recent years, the development of computational thinking (CT) has become integral to many school curricula worldwide. This has been associated with calls for computational thinking to be considered a ‘21St Century’ competency, valuable to all students as a transferable process for solving problems and building understanding of human behaviour and systems. However, while computational thinking is a focus of most secondary school computer science curricula, proponents such as Jeanette Wing argue its relevance for younger students, indicating more work must be done investigating its development in early years' education. This study used a structured, problem-based curriculum supported by guided inquiry pedagogy, to explore 6 year old students' learning of basic computational thinking concepts and practices while coding programmable floor robots (Blue-bots and an iPad app). Results indicated improvement across the seven lessons in students' sequencing/algorithm authoring, error correction, and pattern recognition. Furthermore, they revealed evidence of higher order thinking such as identifying patterns in code, and how these can be transferred to help solve problems of different designs. While currently play-based approaches are used to introduce computational thinking concepts and practices in early years' education, results from this study suggest that more structured, problem-based methods should be seriously considered. Results challenge commonly understood developmental theories about what young children can and can't do, contextualised within the field of computer science, and hold implications for early years' teachers' professional knowledge and pedagogy if they are to promote their students' learning in this increasingly important area. Given rapid technological advancements such as artificial intelligence (AI) and increasingly earlier exposure of young children to digitally-mediated information, this study provides support for the earlier and more systematic introduction of basic digital literacy knowledge and skills in early years' education.

AB  - We conducted a systematic review of empirical studies aimed at exploring robot-mediated activities to promote the development of computational thinking in preschoolers. In this study, we investigated the robots used, proposed activities, and evaluation processes. We also analyzed research contexts and the stated motivations to conduct the studies. Our review identified characteristics of the robots, such as input and output interfaces, cost, and availability. We also categorized activities considering context, modality of work, type of activities, duration, adults’ role, scaffolding, unplugged activities, explicit debugging, communication and sharing instances, and teaching knowledge from other domains. We analyzed the computational thinking evaluation process looking at types of assessments, asset concepts, and research design. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of existing research, identifies existing gaps, and provides recommendations for future studies.

AB  - The integration of computational thinking (CT) into K-12 education offers substantial potential to improve digital literacy and deepen students’ understanding across various subject areas. By embedding computational procedures and solution-oriented approaches into traditional curricula, students can develop essential skills that are critical for thriving in an increasingly digital world. However, the effective integration of CT into subject-specific learning poses challenges for educators, largely due to a lack of training and experience in implementing interdisciplinary instructional strategies. This study explores the impact of integrating CT into K-12 education through diverse instructional approaches, including modelling, storytelling, and unplugged activities. The research examines how students' subject knowledge, CT concepts, and practices evolved under each CT integration practice, as well as their acceptance toward CT integrated lessons. The study was conducted in different subjects, including language arts, biology, and physics, and at different grade levels. The technology acceptance model was used as a theoretical framework to understand students' adoption towards the different integration practices. The study revealed that different CT integration practices yield varying impacts on students' attitudes, particularly in relation to their prior programming experiences. Namely, primary school students with prior programming experience display a higher behavioural intention due to a lack of early biases toward programming. Conversely, secondary school students, less familiar with interdisciplinary approaches, initially show less enthusiasm for future engagement. These insights underscore the need for tailored instructional strategies that consider students' prior experiences and the broader goal of preparing them to contribute to a technologically driven society.

AB  - As we begin to identify essential skills for the future, there has been an increased focus on how to define and implement computational thinking within education. However, the question of how to engage children with coding activities within the context and limitations of the curriculum remains relatively explored. In our study, a human-centered design approach was followed to guide a small group of children through the co-design, implementation and evaluation of a board game. The board game had two versions: an offline version involving a robotic agent and an online version with its digital equivalent. A mixed-method approach was used to understand and compare levels of engagement, usability, and collaboration in both versions of the game. The tangible aspect of working with a robotic agent in the offline version led to greater levels of motivation and involvement with the game mechanics. Tangible robotics games tend to be more approachable for children. Our study shows that using such games by connecting the mathematics curriculum with coding problems can successfully engage participants in collaborative computational thinking activities. We contribute to the field by providing human-centered guidance for the creation of educational tools to develop computational thinking. Such guidance is not only applicable in technologically rich environments; it can also be applied in educational communities with limited access to technology.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has been relevant in teaching STEM courses, and educators are incorporating both plugged and unplugged CT activities in their modules to prepare new entrants for advanced knowledge. However, additional empirical data are needed to understand how an unplugged activities approach can lead to an improved understanding of CT concepts. Therefore, this study investigates the impact of unplugged activities on novice students' CT skills and unravels the characteristics of students' CT competency from performing unplugged activities. The experimental aspect of this study was conducted with a cohort of 210 students participating in an introductory programming course at a University in Nigeria. A mixed-method research approach and a quasi-experimental design were applied in this study to understand how the unplugged approach in teaching CT could help students improve their CT competency. A paired-sample t-test of familiarity score for each CT concept showed a significant increase in the score before and after the intervention. Furthermore, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was used for topic modeling of the text describing students’ solutions. Topic modeling allows for more insights into the steps taken by the students to solve CT problems. Only 27.62 % of students' solution descriptions contained CT concepts, 56.90 % of the students solved the puzzle with an optimal score, and 72.41 % of students who applied CT concepts of problem abstraction and decomposition were able to solve the puzzle correctly. Indeed, CT unplugged activities significantly increased the number of students who gained CT competency. In addition, this study provides recommendation for computer science educators and highlight future direction.

AB  - Computational thinking is a fundamental competence that is being introduced in K-12 and succeeding curricula worldwide. Despite this huge effort, many computational thinking models in the literature do not explicitly take into consideration the pupils’ age and the developmental nature of computational thinking skills. Furthermore, many existing computational thinking models are focused on the internal thinking processes of the individuals, failing to explicitly consider the situated nature, in terms of social context and artefactual environment, that usually characterise tasks that require computational thinking to be solved. In this paper, we present a framework for the design, realisation, analysis, and assessment of computational thinking activities, called CT-cube. The CT-cube allows to extend existing computational thinking models to consider the life-long development of computational thinking skills in individuals, from childhood to adult age, and to take into consideration the situated nature of computational thinking activities. We use the CT-cube to design an unplugged task, called Cross Array Task (CAT), allowing to assess the algorithmic skills of K-12 pupils and we show how the CT-cube can be used in this case to illustrate the development of this competence along the entire compulsory school path, considering a sample of 109 pupil aged 3 to 16 in Switzerland.

AB  - The current single teaching and assessing modes of English as a foreign language (EFL) grammar in China have caused the disconnect between grammar knowledge and competency with numerous errors in essay writing, somehow ignoring the analysis of learners thinking patterns. To solve the problem, computational thinking (CT), a higher-order thinking in solving problems and optimizing the way to acquire knowledge, was employed in the study. As needed, the experimental group was taught using the CT teaching model following CT principal elements (data analysis, pattern recognition, abstraction, decomposition, and parallelization), while the control group followed the traditional teaching mode. Quantitative and qualitative data were obtained based on the pre-test-post-test, classroom observation, and questionnaire survey. The results show that the grammar application in short essay writing of all the members of the experimental group significantly improved and that higher grammar learning agency and engagement were unfolded to show the changes of thinking patterns. However, not all the members from the control group showed similar results. CT serves as an important social mediation tool in EFL teaching. This study further enriches the teaching modes of grammar and is an effective attempt at introducing CT into learners’ thinking patterns.

AB  - With growing interest in supporting the development of computational thinking (CT) in early childhood, there is also need for new assessments that serve multiple purposes and uses. In particular, there is a need to understand the design of formative assessments that can be used during classroom instruction to provide feedback to teachers and children in real-time. In this paper, we report on an empirical study and advance a new unit of observational analysis for formative assessment that we call an indicator of a knowledge refinement opportunity or as a shorthand, KRO indicators. We put forth a new framework for conceptualizing the design of formative assessments that builds on the Evidence Centered Design framework but centers identification and analysis of indicators of knowledge refinement opportunities. We illustrate a number of key indicators through empirical examples drawn from video recordings of Kindergarten classroom lessons.

AB  - Interest in coding education has exploded in the past five years, especially in elementary and early secondary education. Teachers who are largely new to coding are expected to guide entire student bodies through the fundamentals of coding and computational thinking. But little is known about which coding and computational thinking (CT) concepts teachers feel most comfortable with and which concepts they struggle with. This study describes 127 elementary coding teachers’ changes in their beliefs about teaching coding and CT as they participated in year-long continuous professional development. Novice elementary coding teachers demonstrated most growth in their self-efficacy for teaching sequences, algorithms and loops. They were less secure in their knowledge of conditionals, variables, and functions. For computational thinking, teachers were most confident in their ability to identify patterns, think algorithmically, understand logic, and evaluate outcomes, showing less growth with decomposition and abstraction.

AB  - This study compares the effects of coding education with educational robot and unplugged coding activities on pre-school students' computational thinking and executive function skills. This study used a pre-test and post-test comparison group quasi-experimental design. The study was conducted in a public kindergarten with 48 pre-school students (24 educational robot- BeeBot® group and 24-unplugged coding group) aged 5-6. The TechCheck-K test was used to measure computational thinking skills, and Executive Functions Battery-Computerized Touch was used to measure executive function skills. The process started with pre-test applications and ended with post-tests after four weeks (16 different sessions) of the implementation in both groups. The study found a statistically significant difference between the computational thinking pre-test and post-test scores of pre-school students in both groups in favor of the post-test. It was determined that there was a statistically significant difference in favor of the educational robot group between the post-test scores of computational thinking skills. In addition, when the findings regarding executive functions were evaluated, there was a statistically significant difference between the pre-test and post-test scores of total executive function in favor of the post-test in both groups. However, it was observed that there was no statistically significant difference between the post-test scores of both groups in terms of total executive function skills scores. In addition, when the post-test scores of pre-school students in two groups were evaluated, it was determined that there was no significant difference in computational thinking and executive function skills according to gender. Consequently, it was determined that coding education with an educational robot was more effective for gaining computational thinking skills than unplugged coding activities for pre-school students. However, it was observed that there was no difference between the two groups in terms of the development of executive function skills in pre-school education.

AB  - Since environmental and energy issues and challenges continues to emerge as key global concerns, Green Building Certification Systems are becoming increasingly relevant in the construction industry. In this regard, LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is considered one of the most widely recognized environmental assessment methods used globally in the construction industry today. However, due to the high level of complexity of the LEED system, the tools usually used to verify the achievement of the credits lack of “design friendliness” and hardly communicate effectively with the conventional tools used by architects and engineers (e.g. CAD, BIM). This makes difficult to fully take into account, especially at the early design stage, the many interconnected aspects that contribute to the green certification, with consequent issues often arising in the design validation and/or construction phases, resulting in time delays and cost increments. The application of innovative problem-solving methods, such as computational thinking, together with coding techniques, represents an effective way to deal with this issue. This kind of methodology, in fact, allows the requirements of a specific LEED credit to be digitally parametrised and flexibly incorporated into a “designer friendly” working environment. In particular, Visual Programming Languages (VPLs), due to their high simplicity of usage, allow architects and engineers to develop algorithms and thus implement their technical knowledge in the field of environmental design with computer programming skills, useful to improve their tools and keep them constantly updated. The aim of this paper is to illustrate a methodology through which, by merging computational thinking strategies with VPL tools, is possible to keep under control, in the same working environment, all the parameters required to verify in real time the achievement of LEED credits. To demonstrate the flexibility of the approach, dedicated tools developed for the verification of some specific credits at different scales – neighbourhood and building – are illustrated as operational examples of the proposed methodology.

AB  - Computational thinking, defined by Wing (2011) as the “thought processes involved in formulating problems … so that the solutions are represented in a form that can effectively be carried out by an information-processing agent,” has become the central construct of K12 computing education around the world. This article provides a history of computational thinking, a summary of computational thinking's role in educational policy and practice, role as a research construct, and concludes by considering the future of computational thinking. The debate over how to define and teach computational thinking can be understood as a proxy for the broader questions about education.

AB  - Collecting and organizing data to understand and answer real-world questions is an increasingly important skill in our current world. Fostering data collection and analysis (DCA) skills in young children leverages key mathematics skills as well as the data representation, visualization, and interpretation skills of computational thinking (CT), culminating in a problem-solving approach with data. As such, the intervention, comprising investigations and a digital app, supported preschool teachers and children to answer data-focused questions by engaging in each step of the DCA process in order to foster CT and math skills. Teachers appreciated that the app offers a new way for children to visualize data and noted that the app provided learning opportunities for children that would not otherwise be possible or easy to implement. Results also suggest that the app provides a systematic process for data collection, entry, and interpretation. Children in classrooms that completed the intervention had significantly higher scores at post-intervention compared to children in classrooms that did not complete the intervention, controlling for pre-intervention scores, B(SE) = 0.13(0.05), t (6) = 2.48, p = .048.

AB  - Computational Thinking (CT), the conceptual foundations required for solving complex problems effectively and efficiently, is an imperative skill for today's learners, across disciplines and across ages. As for its importance in the wide network of digital literacies, CT has been implemented in various educational contexts, however mostly via digital artifacts, specifically in programming-related activities. This approach does not fulfill the potential of such integration for promoting learning. In this paper, we argue that digital literacies should not be bound to the digital realm, and present a novel approach to fully integrate CT into learning and teaching by the development of CT-infused “unplugged” pedagogical tools that are fully embedded in the subject matter. We demonstrate the advantages to student learning of these tools in two case studies from K-12 mathematics education: 1) An assistive tool for function investigation in high-school calculus – in this case, we point out to how CT skills that were implemented in the tool promoted students' problem solving; 2) A teaching unit for pattern sequences in elementary school – in this case, we show how students in the CT research group outperformed students in the other groups, and how they implemented CT to solve pattern sequence problems effectively and efficiently. We highlight that besides enhancing learning, this approach can help address the important issue of equity in education, and suggest ways to promote it via dedicated professional development.

AB  - Creativity and Computational Thinking (CT) have been pointed out as two important skills that would promote students in the digital age as contributing members of society. Therefore, these two constructs have been extensively researched in recent years, but the associations between them are yet to be fully understood. This study takes another step towards bridging this gap by examining the association between CT and three types of creativity, i.e., Figural Creative Thinking, Verbal Creative Thinking, and Computational Creativity. Data was collected from 119 ninth-grade students (14–15 years old) from Israel. Students took two commonly used creativity tests (Torrance's Test of Creative Thinking, and the Alternative Uses Test). They also used Kodetu—an online learning environment for CT—and we used the system log files to measure their CT acquirement and their computational creativity. Findings suggest some nuanced associations between the four sets of variables. Specifically, we point out the limited associations between verbal and figural creativities, some of which are negative; also, we found that the associations between creative thinking and CT, as well as between creative thinking and computational creativity, differ by gender.

AB  - Many studies have demonstrated that Virtual Exchange (VE) for teaching languages can have a positive effect on learners' intercultural awareness or achievements. However, during this century, the teaching process has shifted from teaching with technology to solving problems with it. In this regard, pedagogical experts in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) have developed programming and robotics based on Computational Thinking skills (CTs), which have been regarded as the core of 21st-century skills. In the field of CALL, this skill has received very little attention. Accordingly, we have attempted to switch the process and outcome of language learning in VE. Thus, we developed the conceptual framework that integrated CTsCALL and Individual-technology-task-environment Fit (ITTEF). Having designed our VE tasks based on CTsCALL, we provided the opportunity for 92 Spanish language learners in our project to exchange language and culture with Cypriot and Irish students and solve VE tasks based on CTsCALL. The result of the symmetric phase of the study validated the five-dimensional structure of CTsCALL and the four-dimensional structures of ITTEF in VE and CALL. It also revealed that language learners, who focused on the key information rather than the details while solving language tasks, as well as recognizing the pattern of task solving and applying them to other tasks, found VE, and CTsCALL to be aligned with their current capabilities, learning environment, and problem-solving skills that mediated their intention to learn and exchange information in this context in the future. Furthermore, the asymmetrical part of the study revealed that sixteen solutions are available to shape language learners' continued intention to use VE by combining the components of CTsCALL and ITTEF. Thus, the study developed the CTsCALL questionnaire and its theory into CALL together with the Council of Europe's Common European Framework of Reference for Languages and recommended that CALL researchers and educators take a broader view of VE, as well as continuing to validate CTsCALL in other CALL disciplines to show that this skill belongs to CALL as well.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is gaining increasing attention from researchers and practitioners all over the world to empower children in the digital era. However, there is no consensus on which components of CT to teach beginning coders in early childhood education (ECE). To address this issue, we conducted a systematic review of 42 empirical studies focused on teaching and assessing CT in ECE. We analyzed the included studies with the three-dimensional CT framework proposed by Brennan and Resnick (2012) and demonstrated how this framework could be modified to fit the context of ECE. Based on this systematic review, we sorted out the CT components that were proven suitable for young children to learn by incorporating emerging components and removing components inappropriate for young children. We thus proposed a CT curriculum framework for ECE that covers CT concepts (i.e., control flow/structures, representation, and hardware/software), CT practices (i.e., algorithmic design, pattern recognition, abstraction, debugging, decomposition, iteration, and generalizing), and CT perspectives (i.e., expressing and creating, connecting, perseverance, and choices of conduct). This systematic review and its associated CT curriculum framework provide important theoretical contributions and practical implications for early childhood CT education.

AB  - In this paper, we review and meta-analyze the findings of experimental studies published between 2006 and 2022 that examined the effects of coding and programming interventions on children's core and higher order executive functions (response inhibition, working memory, cognitive flexibility, planning and problem solving). The systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to address three research questions: 1) Which executive functions are most impacted by the teaching of CT? 2) Which instructional modality (educational robotics/virtual coding/unplugged coding) is most effective in enhancing executive function skills in learners aged 4–16 years? and 3) Does the cognitive effectiveness of coding vary with children's age? A total of 19 studies with 1523 participants met the selection criteria for the systematic review. The meta-analysis included 11 of those studies. The results reveal beneficial effects of structured virtual and tangible coding (educational robotics) activities for preschoolers and first graders, and significant effects of more unstructured virtual coding activities (e.g., Scratch-based) for older students. A multivariate fixed-effects model meta-analysis shows that the teaching of coding significantly improves problem-solving with the highest effect (dppc2 = 0.89), but also planning (dppc2 = 0.36), and inhibition and working memory with lower effects (dppc2 = 0.17, dppc2 = 0.20).

AB  - In light of the increasing importance digital economy, the significance of computational thinking has grown exponentially, becoming imperative in both workplace and academic settings such as universities. This article addresses the critical need to comprehend the factors influencing the acceptance of computational thinking. The dataset introduces an extensive questionnaire comprising five constructs and 25 items, rooted in the extended Technology Acceptance Model. Notably, the model incorporates facilitating conditions and subjective norm, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding acceptance. Data collection involved 132 undergraduate university students sampled through purposive sampling, specifically targeting courses with a focus on computational thinking. The resulting dataset serves as a valuable resource for future research, offering detailed insights into the factors determining the acceptance of technology in educational contexts beyond mere thinking skills. Given the scarcity of research on technology acceptance in developing nations, this dataset holds particular significance, serving as a foundation for potential cross-cultural comparisons. The dataset contributes to the field by presenting a robust acceptance model, explaining 74.2 per cent of the variance in behavioural intention, 60.2 per cent in perceived usefulness, and 56.1 per cent in perceived ease of use. This high explanatory power positions the dataset as a superior resource for replication, benchmarking, and broader applicability in diverse contexts, thereby enhancing the understanding of computational thinking acceptance across different populations and settings. This dataset stands among the pioneering efforts to assess the novel covariance-based structural equation model algorithm within SmartPLS 4, presenting a valuable resource for future research employing the same mechanism.

AB  - This paper describes a study designed to investigate the promise of resources that support the development of computational thinking (CT) in preschool children. This study was the culmination of a collaborative research process between researchers and media developers of a home-based intervention that included media and hands-on activities created to support the development of young children's CT. The mixed-methods study included 108 families, each with a 4- or 5-year-old child. Families, who participated in the study at home for six weeks, were randomly assigned to an intervention group that viewed media and engaged with hands-on activities with a CT focus or a control group that viewed and engaged with non-STEM literacy content. Data collection consisted of parent surveys, parent interviews, and CT learning and pre-coding tasks to assess children's CT abilities. Results indicate that the learning intervention demonstrates promise in supporting parental understanding of CT. Experience with the intervention over the six weeks also appeared to cultivate some CT strategy use in children as evidenced by parental reports and performance on learning and pre-coding sequencing tasks.

AB  - This study characterizes the literature on teaching computational thinking (CT) to preschoolers aged 4 to 5 years. Previous research and published systematic studies have provided important contributions about CT teaching to elementary and high school children. However, to date, there is no systematic overview of CT education for preschoolers. For this reason, this systematic mapping synthesizes 82 studies on CT teaching, through the implementation and evaluation of tools and activities to teach, improve or measure the CT knowledge acquired by children. Furthermore, studies on courses or training offered to preschool teachers related to the teaching of CT were also considered. From the selected studies, the following information was collected: year of publication; recovery sources and databases; vehicles and places of publication; temporal delimitation of research, research approach, nature and research method; CT teaching approaches; tools used to teach CT and how they are classified according to their physical characteristics and, finally, participants and individuals responsible for the research. The results suggest an increase in the number of publications in recent years, revealing the interest of researchers in the topic. Furthermore, we observed a trend towards the use of physical artifacts and the use of the disconnected computing approach to teaching CT skills to preschool children. The results also exposed that preschool teachers have little autonomy in implementing CT teaching activities because those are mostly implemented by computer professionals (researchers, teachers, etc.). This is because preschool teachers are still discouraged from teaching computer and technology-related content to children, considering them complex and disconnected from basic curricula. However, when teachers are trained to teach CT, they become interested in the content and become more active during the teaching process. We argue for integrating CT-related content into education curricula and supporting preschool teachers to implement it autonomously in their classrooms.

AB  - This paper deals within a context where technology plays a pivotal role in education. In this sense, it is essential to highlight the emergence of new competencies and skills in education due to technological advancements. Legislative frameworks have been developed to incorporate digital literacy, access to robotics, and computational thinking, between others. Hence, this review and meta-analysis aim at identifying the influence of robotics activities on computational thinking through a PRISMA-guided review. The findings reveal that interventions conducted in early childhood education significantly impact computational thinking. Results also showcase that, despite perceived barriers related to technology accessibility, the presence of legislation and contexts prioritizing these competencies is more relevant than the digital access gap.

AB  - Since computational thinking is a high-level cognitive skill and its conceptual framework has not yet been clarified, the assessment of this skill is problematic. While there is no consensus in the literature about the components of computational thinking, the abstraction component is located at a point where opinions intersect. In addition, it is predicted that computer science unplugged activities will improve computational thinking, and there is limited research examining this effect. As a result, this research aims to demonstrate the alleged effects of computer science unplugged activities on abstraction skill which is considered the critical component of computational thinking. The study, which was planned with a mixed methods research design, lasted 8 weeks. Quantitative data were obtained from the abstraction skill test developed by the researchers, while qualitative data were obtained from observations and task- based interviews after each activity. Quantitative findings showed that computer science unplugged activities significantly improve abstraction skills and thus computational thinking. Qualitative findings not only revealed that developments in the six abstracting steps caused this significant difference but also identified abstracting steps where the effect of each activity was limited. Suggestions for organizing activities to improve these steps are given. Finally, suggestions are presented for the conceptual framework of computational thinking based on abstraction.

AB  - The healthy development of cognitive functions, including executive functions, has been shown to depend mainly on the experiences and learning opportunities of people, especially during childhood. Over the past few years, researchers have been studying the impacts of diverse types of interventions on children’s cognitive development in which computational thinking programs are a recent field. This pilot study evaluated the effect of computational thinking training based on the “Programming for Children” program on the executive functions of children aged 10 and 11 years: working memory, inhibition, and planning (N = 30). The results showed that children in the experimental group improved on tests of visuospatial working memory, cognitive inhibition, and sequential planning compared with the control group. However, tests of verbal working memory, memory strategy, and visual spatial planning did not show any observed changes. Although this was an exploratory study, and its findings should be interpreted cautiously due to the small sample size, the findings support the relevance and feasibility of conducting similar larger studies with larger samples.

AB  - Computational thinking has been promoted as an impactful 21st-century skillset that can be transferred to many other disciplines and problem scenarios. With the proliferation of age-appropriate coding platforms for young children, computational thinking has become increasingly popular in early childhood settings. However, there is a lack of research on introducing coding and computational thinking to teacher training in early childhood education. To empower early childhood teachers in the digital society, this study introduced 17 early childhood teachers to robot programming and computational thinking through the ‘CT4ECE’ professional development program, which includes three phases: Learn, Practice, and Reflect & Improve. Results of pre- and post-intervention surveys revealed that the CT4ECE program significantly enhanced teachers' robotics and pedagogical knowledge, as well as their attitudes towards computational thinking, especially their interest in and their view of using computational thinking in classroom practice. Post-intervention interviews indicated that participation in CT4ECE helped educators gain a basic understanding of both coding robots and computational thinking suitable for young children due to a structured change process for teachers' professional learning. This study establishes a strong foundation for enhancing and expanding the CT4ECE program, ultimately equipping teachers and children with the necessary skillsets to thrive in the digital future.

AB  - The purpose of the current study is to investigate the effects of the unplugged computational thinking (CT) integrated STEM (UCT-STEM) approach and STEM approach on early childhood pre-service teachers’ CT skills (creativity, algorithmic thinking, critical thinking, problem solving, cooperativity, communication). The study was conducted with a total of 70 early childhood pre-service teachers. Quasi-experimental design was used; activities based on the UCT-STEM approach were administered to the experimental group and activities based on the STEM approach were administered to the control group. Post-test scores for CT skills showed a statistically significant difference in favour of the experimental group. It was concluded that the UCT-STEM approach was more effective in developing the pre-service teachers’ CT skills than the STEM approach. The current study presents an important finding to the literature in terms of the developed STEM and UCT-STEM contents and how these contents improve pre-service teachers’ CT skills. The STEM and UCT-STEM content provides significant information in terms of teacher practices. At the same time, this study offers important implications for program developers and policy-makers to integrate these innovative educational approaches into both early childhood education and teacher education programs.

AB  - The integration of computational thinking (CT) to enhance creativity in design students has often been underexplored in design education. While design thinking has traditionally been the cornerstone of university design pedagogy and remains essential, the increasing role of digital tools and artificial intelligence in modern design practices presents new opportunities for innovation. By introducing CT alongside design thinking, students can expand their creative toolkit and engage with emerging technologies more effectively. Although many design students may have limited experience with programming, incorporating accessible, no-code tools can help them confidently embrace computational methods, unlocking new pathways for creative exploration and innovation. This study proposes an alternative approach to improve the motivation of design students by introducing machine learning tools into product design processes. We developed an experimental pedagogy in which 56 industrial design university students learned how to use Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (Weka), a machine learning tool, for three hours of design work a week, for a total of eight weeks. Our covariate analysis of data collected in the pretest and posttest shows that the general learning motivations in the group using Weka are significantly higher than those in the group without Weka. However, no significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of learning strategies, collaboration, or critical thinking. Students using Weka spent more time focusing on model training and tended to improve their algorithmic thinking, and the introduction of Weka appeared to enhance their motivation to learn. On the other hand, these students might have been focusing on working individually at their computers, potentially neglecting communication and collaboration. The findings suggest that teaching machine learning applications without requiring coding has the potential to boost design students' motivation to engage with CT skills, though care must be taken to maintain collaborative practices.

AB  - There is increasing effort to integrate Computational Thinking (CT) curricula across all education levels. Therefore, research on CT assessment has lately progressed towards developing and validating reliable CT assessment tools, which are crucial for evaluating students' potential learning progress and thus the effectiveness of suggested curricular programs. Several CT assessment tools were developed for elementary, high-school, and university students over the last years. Moreover, associations between CT scores and other cognitive abilities were unraveled. However, studies on the topic in primary school level are scarce. Like the general concept of intelligence, CT remains broadly defined as the ability to combine algorithmic operations to form complex solutions in order to solve problems effectively, utilizing concepts of computer science with or without the use of computers. In this study, we aimed at specifying a cognitive definition of CT, focusing on the under-investigated population of primary school children. Since validated assessment tools for this age group were not available, we adapted a validated CT test, which was initially designed for middle school students. In our study participated 192 third and fourth graders. The analyses revealed promising results on the reliability of the adapted CT assessment for primary school students. Moreover, findings indicated CT's positive associations with i. complex numerical abilities, ii. verbal reasoning abilities, and iii. non-verbal visuospatial abilities. Our results indicate similarities but also differences in associations of CT with other cognitive abilities in primary school children compared to other age groups. In summary: i. numerical abilities seem to associate with CT at the primary school level, whereas this seems not the case later on in education, ii. verbal abilities seem to associate with CT both along primary and secondary education levels, and iii. non-verbal reasoning abilities seem to associate with CT from primary education level to the university level and beyond. These differences imply that several basic cognitive abilities support CT abilities and CT development differentially across ages.

AB  - The concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI), born as the possibility of simulating the human brain's learning capabilities, quickly evolves into one of the educational technology concepts that provide tools for students to better themselves in a plethora of areas. Unlike the previous educational technology iterations, which are limited to instrumental use for providing platforms to build learning applications, AI has proposed a unique education laboratory by enabling students to explore an instrument that functions as a dynamic system of computational concepts. However, the extent of the implications of AI adaptation in modern education is yet to be explored. Motivated to fill the literature gap and to consider the emerging significance of AI in education, this paper aims to analyze the possible intertwined relationship between students’ intrinsic motivation for learning Artificial Intelligence during the COVID-19 pandemic; the relationship between students’ computational thinking and understanding of AI concepts; and the underlying dynamic relation, if existing, between AI and computational thinking building efforts. To investigate the mentioned relationships, the present empirical study employs mediation analysis based upon collected 137 survey data from Universidad Politécnica de Madrid students in the Institute for Educational Science and the School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering during the first quarter of 2022. Findings show that intrinsic motivation mediates the relationship between perceived Artificial Intelligence learning and computational thinking. Also, the research indicates that intrinsic motivation has a significant relationship with computational thinking and perceived Artificial Intelligence learning.

AB  - Computational thinking is widely recognized as an essential skill for adapting to the current era, with programming learning being the most effective means to develop it. It is recommended that computational thinking and learning programming be introduced as early as elementary school. However, elementary school students often possess limited prior knowledge of programming, posing challenges in their learning process. The graphic organizers (GOs) may serve as a bridge between students’ existing knowledge and new learning, facilitating a deeper processing of the overall information and thereby enhancing the learning process. This can be particularly advantageous for early-stage learners when grappling with difficult subjects. Consequently, this study employed GOs to assist elementary school students in their computational thinking and programming learning, employing a quasi-experiment design to evaluate their effectiveness. The results showed that although all students demonstrated awareness of applying computational thinking to solve problems, those exposed to GO-based instruction exhibited higher levels of computational thinking, programming skills, and flow experiences.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) practices is a critical cognitive tool for students to overcome challenges in this technological era. Few studies investigated CT practices from a development perspective. A two-year intervention was implemented in 30 intervention and 22 control schools in Hong Kong to promote CT education (T1baseline: N = 13,056; T2: N = 16,367; and T3: N = 15,269). Senior primary students (grades 4 to 6) around 8–12 years old were targeted. Among them, 34% were girls at T1baseline. Their learning progression of cognitive development was assessed with a CT practices test. Data were analyzed using item response analysis. Learning trajectories of CT practices were modeled to understand how students’ cognitive development differed between schools. Insights of findings were discussed in bringing CT practices to life.

AB  - Engagement is critical to computational thinking and programming education. However, as multi-dimensional variables, when analyzing how different aspects of engagement in computational thinking tasks influence skills development, it becomes crucial to discern precisely which engagement components intersect with the progression of computational thinking skills. This discernment is pivotal because engagement can vary based on the task nature, the context, and the individual's preferences. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the gender differences in engagement and computational thinking skills and the predictive relationships among these sub-dimensions for boys and girls in an unplugged environment. In this study, a quasi-experiment for 90 sixth-grade students from a north Chinese primary school was performed. By partial least squares–structural equation modeling, students’ models of computational thinking skills and engagement were analyzed, and comparisons of boys and girls were made by analysis of covariance statistics. Results indicated that compared with boys, girls reported higher computational thinking performance and more engagement in unplugged contexts. Furthermore, girls’ computational thinking skills were only predicted by their cognitive engagement, whereas boys’ computational thinking skills were predicted by their behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement. Teachers can adopt these findings to design computational thinking teaching interventions that combine the advantages of unplugged activity and focus on the engagement of boys and girls.

AB  - In this work, we argue for expanding the scope of K-12 computational thinking (CT) integration contexts to include everyday scenarios involving moral reasoning. Epistemic overlap between computational thinking practices and moral reasoning suggest that these contexts are potentially rich sites to see “seeds of CT” in children's reasoning and can provide rich educational pathways for children into CT. Taking a case-study approach, we examine the reasoning of a second-grader, Ollie, on a task involving fair allocation of resources to victims of a natural disaster. Our analysis finds that Ollie's reasoning was rich with seeds of CT (e.g., problem formulation, abstraction, complex-systems thinking) and that empathy served as an important supporting role to the CT. This work has implications for curricular design, suggesting that fairness and resource allocation scenarios with built-in opportunities for empathy might provide rich sandboxes for CT integration.

AB  - Although there are different definitions for computational thinking in the literature, it is possible to define it mainly as problem solving, designing and interpreting new systems by thinking like a computer. According to Wing (2006), computational thinking is a way of designing a system and understanding human behaviors by focusing on the basic concepts of the computer sciences. The recent focus on computational thinking as a key 21 st century skill for all students has led to a number of curriculum initiatives to embed it in K-12 classrooms and to introduce computing ideas to students early during their schooling years. The present study aims to explore the effects of a short, intensive coding and robotics training on the computational thinking skill self-efficacy of middle school students. 24 fifth graders participated in the study and data were collected by means of the Computational Thinking Self-efficacy scale (CTS) and one open-ended question. Analyses of the pre, post and delayed tests revealed significant differences between the pre and post-tests.

AB  - Methodological innovations across social sciences are opening new avenues for conducting research designed to address real-world challenges. The benefits of utilizing the Design-Based Implementation Research (DBIR) approach in public libraries to resolve a persistent problem of practice, a lack of assessment tools to evaluate youth Computational Thinking (CT) programs, is demonstrated. Findings from a three-year, three-phased study utilizing the DBIR approach to design and implement a suite of assessment tools to assess CT programming in public libraries are presented. Guided by the four principles of the DBIR approach, this research produced new knowledge, including identifying CT program outcomes, challenges, and recommendations for designing and implementing assessment tools to measure the impact of public libraries' CT programming. Findings underscore the DBIR approach as a strategy for engaging with practitioners and helping shift their perspectives by resolving practice problems and facilitating the design of sustainable solutions.

AB  - Although there is controversy surrounding rewards and competition in education, they are key elements in digital game-based learning (DGBL). Research on the influence of rewards and competition in DGBL often yields mixed results, suggesting a need to investigate individual game elements and their interactions. This study implemented DGBL focusing on computational thinking (CT) in 7th-grade classes. Both quantitative and behavioral data were collected to understand the impact of rewards (power-up or customization) and competition (with or without) on students’ intrinsic motivation, game performance, behaviors, and CT skills. The findings uncovered significant interactions between rewards and competition. Students with both competition and power-up rewards achieved the highest game points but the lowest CT performance, whereas those exposed to the same power-up rewards without competition attained the lowest game points but the best CT performance. Implications are drawn for DGBL research and practice.

AB  - Despite growing interest in early childhood computational thinking (CT), there is a lack of validated assessments for children who are emerging readers. This paper presents validity and reliability evidence of a performance-based assessment of CT using item response theory (IRT) from 272 children aged 4–8. Using a two-parameter logistic model IRT model (2PL IRT), we confirmed that model- and item-level fits are acceptable. Item analyses revealed a high discriminability (M = 2.26, SD = 1.12) and a moderate item difficulty (M = −0.21; SD = 0.86), on average, across 19 items. Reliability analysis demonstrated that the assessment was substantially reliable (marginal reliability: rxx = 0.87). Differential item functioning (DIF) analyses indicated that the assessment estimated children's item parameters fairly, regardless of their gender and age. However, we confirmed gaps in latent ability (θ) of CT by gender and age: boys showed higher latent ability of CT than girls, and old children (above 72 months) showed higher latent ability than young children (below 72 months). Findings suggest the assessment is a fair measure that can serve as a reliable and valid tool to assess CT for children who are emerging readers.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is an important and essential skill for human beings to master in the 21st century. Although CT has received wide attention since this concept was proposed, the current theoretical models have not well defined the complex relations between CT and other cognitive abilities for young children. To provide insight into this gap, the current study proposed a model in which we hypothesized that CT was significantly related to arithmetic fluency that is viewed as an important domain of mathematics. Additionally, arithmetic fluency was predicted to mediate the relations of CT to other cognitive abilities, including reasoning and creativity. This study tested such direct and indirect relations in children aged 5–6 years. Consistent with previous studies on older age groups, the results showed that CT and arithmetic fluency were significantly related to each other and both were significantly related to reasoning ability and creative thinking as well. Moreover, this study, for the first time, indicated that arithmetic fluency totally mediated the relation between CT and reasoning ability, suggesting that these concepts share conceptual commonalities, such as the cognitive processes related to mathematics or/and abstraction; in contrast, arithmetic fluency did not mediate the relation between CT and creative thinking, suggesting that gaining CT skill may exert direct positive effect on the development of creativity. Therefore, despite the root in computer science, CT is associated with many cognitive and learning abilities in other domains, supporting the importance of including CT into early school education.

Learning games offer the potential for innovative, stealth assessments of students' implicit learning from gameplay behaviors. This paper reports on the measurement of implicit CT practices demonstrated by upper elementary- and middle-school students as they play the CT learning game Zoombinis. The process of using the gameplay log data to build valid automated detectors of students' implicit CT practices is discussed. Findings from this study provide implications for analyzing gameplay behaviors at scale, leading to the development of models for the assessment of implicit STEM learning.

We report on the design, evaluation, and outcomes of the Computational Thinking Unplugged for Science (CT-UP-S) professional development program for inservice science teachers. Our process-based approach to CT significantly improved teachers CT understanding and CT/science integration self-efficacy by systematically linking CT practices to scaffold the generation of unplugged algorithms. Additionally, we found that the process-based approach provided a framework for teachers' lesson planning and that teachers’ content knowledge moderated their ability to write CT-integrated science lessons.

AB  - Early evidence suggests that robot programming offers an important foundation for spatial reasoning and computational thinking; however, researchers have debated how to introduce young children to these skills. We explored how preschoolers develop understanding of spatial concepts and computational thinking as the children took turns navigating a path during guided play with a programmable robot. Our analysis of the data included a multimodal visualization of the exchanges between the teacher, children, and a programmable robotic device. The findings highlight the effects that arose from the physical-digital convergence of technology integrated into play including: (a) the robot evoked a chain of actions, enacting pedagogic forces that transformed children's learning; (b) children used their own bodies as spatial referents, co-locating themselves in space with the robot; (c) the teacher remained a key actor, providing verbal and nonverbal scaffolding to promote children's understanding and mastery of spatial and computational concepts; and (d) talking with the teacher about spatial concepts combined with the interactions with the robot enhanced children's acquisition of spatial ideas relative to the quantity of children's verbal expressions and complexity of their applied spatial skills and computational thinking.

AB  - Workers in the areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics play a significant role in the sustained growth and stability of the global economy, and, thus constitute a critical component in helping all countries worldwide to prosper. In this context, computational thinking constitutes an important skill to have as it enables workers to develop creative solutions to complex problems. Nonetheless, across all economies worldwide, there is a need to have more workers who are able to think through problems, challenges, and solutions in computational terms. It is thus of utmost importance to integrate the teaching of computational thinking in K-12 education in order to reduce the skills gap between education and the workplace. A pertinent and crucial question that arises is whether teachers have the knowledge and skills to teach students how to think computationally. Existing research shows that teacher education departments do not currently have the knowledge to promote computational thinking in their programs. The present study focuses on two aspects of computational thinking, such as, algorithmic thinking and debugging skills with the use of scaffolded programming scripts in an educational technology undergraduate course. The results show statistically significant learning gains in pre-service teachers’ algorithmic thinking and debugging skills in the context of robotic programming activities with LEGO WeDo. Limitations and future research directions are discussed.

AB  - Recent studies identify Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) as a key factor in enhancing cognitive development, particularly within Computational Thinking (CT) literature. However, research gaps remain in understanding how SRL and CT interact from a developmental perspective. Our study designed a program with tailored animations and worksheets to specifically foster students' learning and cognitive development. Using a mixed-methods approach, we administered surveys among 1235 students from 29 Hong Kong primary schools to investigate a dynamic learning system comprising SRL and CT in a large-scale CT program. Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 students to further probe insights. Quantitative findings revealed a mutually reinforcing relationship in the dynamic system, suggesting that higher SRL skills enhance cognitive CT abilities, and vice versa. Complementing these results, qualitative findings showed that integrating animations and worksheets into the CT program significantly boosted students' SRL and cognitive development. These findings have significant implications for educational practices and curriculum design. Schools should consider implementing SRL strategies, such as proactive goal setting and reflective evaluation, within their curricula to promote students’ cognitive development. Furthermore, strategic investments in educational technology, including collaborations with EdTech developers, are essential to create effective, pedagogically sound tools that enhance learning outcomes. These insights provide valuable guidance for creating a supportive SRL environment that fosters cognitive development in primary school education.

AB  - In recent years, there has been increasing interest in integrating Computational Thinking (CT) into elementary schools. However, few studies have focused on teachers’ perceptions. This study aims to examine teachers' perceptions to bridge the gap between theory and practice. The study analysed teachers’ perceptions of integrating CT into school subjects through the constructionist approach, using Scratch a leading programming platform inspired by Resnick's Lifelong Kindergarten Constructionist model. Over a school year, 31 teachers participated in a professional development program and applied this model in their classrooms. The teachers were interviewed to capture their perceptions of learning and teaching using a constructionist method. The findings revealed that teachers with creative arts experience fully embraced the model, while others partially adopted it. Teachers recognized the benefits of constructionist teaching in fostering creativity, motivation, and engagement among students. However, they struggled with balancing these benefits with school demands and constraints. Challenges included managing time effectively within constraints of school and ensuring curriculum alignment. Despite this, many teachers found that the constructionist approach positively impacted students' learning engagement and personal development. By addressing the identified challenges, teacher education designers, curriculum developers, and schools can develop practices for closing the gap between theory and practice.

AB  - Educational research on predicting learners’ computer programming performance has yielded practical implications that guide task designs in computer education. There have been attempts to investigate learners’ computer programming patterns using high-frequency and automated data collection. This approach can be considered as process-based analysis as opposed to outcome-based analysis (i.e., the use of test or exam scores). In this process-based approach to investigate learners’ computer programming process, we included two critical constructs in our research, self-regulated learning and computational thinking skills. We aimed to identify learners’ computer programming patterns in the context that novice students learn a computer programming language, Python, in an online coding environment. We examined the relationships between the learners’ coding patterns, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills. Initially, we adopted a traditional approach with the aggregate data of learners’ computer programming behaviors. We then utilized a computational analytics approach to learner performance, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills, with ever-changing computer programming patterns. In our initial approach, the indicators of aggregate computer programming data were not associated with learners' learning performance and computational thinking skills. In the computational analysis approach, many indicators revealed significant differences between the identified patterns regarding computational thinking skills and self-regulated learning. Recommendations about the use of programming log data analysis methods and future scaffolding for computer programming learners are addressed.

AB  - In the field of education, research has consistently emphasized mathematical creative thinking as a crucial component of 21st-century skills. Thus, this cross-sectional study examines the predictors of such thinking by specifically focusing on the roles of perceived creativity, creative self-efficacy, and computational thinking. The participants consisted of 896 secondary school students (52.9 % female; 47.1 % male) in Indonesia who were asked to complete a series of online questionnaires and tests. For analysis, structural equation modeling was employed, demonstrating satisfactory construct validity and instrument reliability. Based on the results, there was a positive association between computational thinking and mathematical creative thinking. In addition, perceived creativity had a positive impact on mathematical creative thinking, whereas creative self-efficacy showed a negative association. As for the empirical model, it revealed that computational thinking plays a mediating role, connecting perceived creativity and creative self-efficacy to mathematical creative thinking. The findings suggest that incorporating these skills and related variables into the mathematics curriculums in schools is essential for preparing students for success in the 21st century.

AB  - Previous studies have explored the relationship between computational thinking (CT) and creativity. However, a consensus has yet to be reached since both CT and creativity varied in ideation and assessment. To uncover the cognitive mechanism underlying the interplay between CT and creativity, we conduct a scoping review of 26 empirical studies published in 2006–2024. Our findings suggested that the effects of working memory varied in the interplay between CT and creativity due to differences in age range, neural network activation regions, and measurements. Intellectual abilities, including algorithmic fluency, reasoning ability, and coding ability, showed cognitive transfer effect on CT skills but not necessarily on creativity, suggesting that cognitive abilities embracing more intelligent elements may contribute to the functional connectivity in CT neural networks but only partly overlapped with creativity involved networks. Although executive functions (working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control) play a crucial role in both CT and creativity, their contributions to the CT-creativity interplay are still rarely studied. Future research should explore the CT-creativity relationship from the perspective of neuroscience.

AB  - This systematic review examined how computer science (CS) education was implemented in schools and its efficacy for developing students’ computational thinking (CT). Sixty-six papers were selected for this systematic review and analyzed for patterns in relation to the implementation of CS education in K-12 schools and its impact on the development of students’ CT skills. Although educational interventions have not always been successful in CS education, this review provides strong evidence that overall, CS education promotes the development of students’ CT in the K-12 setting while improving their creative and critical thinking skills. We recommend early access to CS education, various innovative instructional approaches to CS education and appropriate support and guidance for student learning.

AB  - Recently, the development of computational thinking (CT) skills has become widespread in the whole world. There is a consensus to develop students’ CT skills through unplugged and plugged-in programming. However, the choice of programming approaches taught in schools is arbitrary and few studies have compared the effectiveness differences between unplugged and plugged-in programming. This study aimed to explore the differences between unplugged and plugged-in programming in developing CT skills of students in Grades 1-2 students. It also explored the joint effects of students’ gender, programming experience, programming interest, and programming confidence with different programming approaches on CT skills. The quasi-experimental research approach was used to conduct 10 weeks of unplugged, plugged-in, and regular programming activities with 124 Grades 1-2 students. The results found that unplugged programming promoted CT skills more in the early primary grades than plugged-in programming. We found that boys and students with programming experience in unplugged group performed significantly better in CT skills than in plugged-in group. Moreover, the improvement of CT skills of students in unplugged group was positively correlated with the level of their programming interest and programming confidence. However, these were not observed in plugged-in group. The results of this study can provide precise guidance for teaching CT skills to early primary school students and provide references for CT education.

AB  - This paper presents an investigation that compares and analyzes the interactions of three groups of pre-and-primary school children with three different storytelling systems. We identify emerging patterns through which they engaged in what we refer to as narrative computational thinking. The latter describes broadened aspects of narrative literacy practices that are linked to computational thinking. By applying a multicase study approach and through various vignettes, we illustrate how children applied computational thinking to understand and influence the narrative possibilities offered by the different tools. Our results illustrate circumstances under which digital storytelling activities provide a favorable basis for narrative computational thinking, and that when computational thinking functions as a scaffold for story creation, it encourages a blend of creativity and computational thinking, providing a compelling approach to introducing emerging digital literacies to young children in a narrative context.

AB  - In this study, it is aimed to identify the computational thinking skills used by gifted and talented students in integrated STEM activities based on the EDP. The case study design, a qualitative research method, is employed in the study. The participants consist of gifted and talented students attending the Science and Arts Center. Integrated STEM activities based on the EDP were conducted over the course of ten weeks and among these activities, robotic and 3D modeling-based robot construction activities using Lego sets are addressed in the present study. The STEM activity booklet, researchers' fieldnotes, and teaching process video recordings were used as data collection tools in the study. Data that was collected was analyzed through content analysis. It was seen that gifted and talented students participating in integrated STEM activities based on the EDP make active use of critical thinking skills while providing explanations, making associations, questioning information, giving justifications, solving problems, thinking creatively, making generalizations, and attempting to convince others; as for the instances of defining problems, creating solutions, and evaluating the effectiveness of the solution, the students were observed to actively use their problem-solving skills. The detailed account provided by the study on the way robotic and 3D robot modeling activities improve the computational thinking skills of gifted and talented students contributes to the required educational support and to the existing body of literature.

AB  - In the artificial intelligence age, cultivating young children's computational thinking (CT) has sparked tremendous attention. Programmable robotics is a developmental-appropriate and screen-free means that provides young children with great opportunities to learn programming and develop CT. However, it is reported that young children might have difficulties learning abstract CT concepts. As a helpful pedagogical facilitator, metaphors can help turn abstract concepts into more concrete and clear concepts that learners are familiar with. Therefore, this research proposed a metaphor-based robot programming (MRP) approach and explored its impact on young children's CT and behavioral patterns. A total of 118 children aged 5–6 were recruited in this experiment with two conditions: the experimental group adopted the metaphor-based robot programming (MRP) approach while the control group used the conventional robot programming (CRP) approach. Results revealed that children who adopted the MRP approach outperformed children who adopted the CRP approach on CT. In addition, behavioral analysis indicated that the proposed MRP approach could facilitate children's superior learning performance and more positive learning behaviors, so as to help them achieve learning objectives. Accordingly, this study can provide insightful guidance and inspiration for future research on effective programming teaching and CT development for young children.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is a necessary skill for students. It is as important as the other essential skills such as reading, writing, and arithmetic. However, how to improve students’ CT in robotics is still to be explored. Hence, this study examined the effects of computer supported project-based learning (CSPBL) on students’ CT and learning engagement through comparing students’ CT and engagement in two courses instructed by the same instructor (one instructed with a traditional method, the other instructed with CSPBL). Participants were seventy-nine students from a university in China. Questionnaires, interviews, and project analysis were used to measure students’ CT and learning engagement. The comparative results of self-reports and final projects indicated that the CSPBL enhanced students’ CT. The simulation project training based on the SenseStudy learning platform in CSPBL helped students debug the programming code, optimize the algorithm design, and improve their algorithmic thinking, cooperation, and problem solving during the program error correction. The CSPBL also improved students’ engagement in learning, especially for those with more than one year of programming experience. It was found that the CSPBL was effective in terms of improving students’ CT and engagement in robotics learning. This study provides teachers with practical suggestions to conduct effective robotics instruction.

AB  - Malaysia has introduced computational thinking skills as part of a curriculum integration update to meet the global trends in 21st-century education, focusing on empowering digital literacy. Nevertheless, a preliminary investigation revealed an apparent lack of understanding of computational thinking skills in general among teachers. The study explores the feasibility of developing a localized E-learning system to train computational thinking skills among teachers. An E-learning system, termed as myCTGWBL, was developed on the basis of a newly proposed conceptual framework to present computational thinking teaching–learning repertoire to the teachers. The hypothesis is that myCTGWBL would develop teachers' computational thinking and its position in teaching–learning understanding. myCTGWBL relevance was tested through DeLone and McLean's information system and Urbach's collaboration quality construct. To determine the success factors, partial least squares structural equation modeling was used. A total of 369 teachers participated in a two-stage survey. Participants' understanding of computational thinking and perceptions were recorded at the pre- and post-intervention phases. Open-ended questions of the surveys were analyzed using a simple text analysis technique. The closed-ended questions surveys were analyzed using SPSS Statistics 22.0. A significant improvement in teachers' computational thinking teaching–learning repertoire in a relatively short period has been recorded. Teachers also demonstrated increased confidence in the future delivering computational thinking-based lessons. The E-learning conceptual framework has illustrated the predictive power between user intent, user satisfaction, and Computational thinking (CT) knowledge benefits. Results demonstrate that myCTGWBL could be used to guide future planning when establishing CT knowledge acquisition initiatives, particularly among teachers.

AB  - Efforts to incorporate computational thinking (CT) into academic courses have been gaining popularity. CT is a problem-solving skill that is crucial in the 21st century. CT may be used to support language education. Courses in English as a foreign language often need an effective writing component that includes writing organization and language use, as demonstrated by the poor writing samples often generated by students of these courses. To address the problems, CT, which is a higher-order mode of problem-solving and knowledge acquisition optimization, was used. The experimental group was instructed using the CT teaching model based on CT's essential components (decomposition, generalization, abstraction, algorithm, and evaluation), whereas the control group was taught using the conventional method. In total, 58 undergraduate students divided into two groups participated in this study. A combination of writing, CT skills, surveys, and interviews were used to collect data according to an experimental design. The collected quantitative data were analyzed through analysis of covariance and structural equation modeling, and the MAXQDA 2022software was used to analyze the collected qualitative data. The results of this study indicate that incorporating CT into an English writing course enhances the writing and higher-order thinking skills of students. The CT concepts helps students develop critical thinking skills by evaluating the text and identifying potential issues or improvements. Additionally, it allows students to use their skills to create unique writing solutions, which can boost English writing creativity.

AB  - Computational thinking education has become an increasingly popular topic among practitioners and researchers. However, rare is known how to effectively teach and learn computational thinking in early childhood education. To address this knowledge gap, this systematic review examined 26 studies on the teaching and learning of computational thinking in early childhood education from 2010 to 2022. The content knowledge, tools, pedagogical design, assessment methods, and learning outcomes were analyzed. Results indicated that, with age-appropriate instructional design, children could develop early concepts and skills of computational thinking, as well as other related skills such as communication, collaboration, and problem solving. Across the studies, we found that most studies used quantitative research methods, with direct assessment and observation being the most. Several challenges were identified: (1) achieving a deeper learning of computational thinking; (2) a lack of valid and reliable computational thinking assessments for children with a wider age range; (3) selecting appropriate learning tools; and (4) designing age-appropriate activities for young learners. Although with these challenges, computational thinking education could bring new learning opportunities and enhance children's computational thinking skills, as well as other non-cognitive skills such as critical thinking, body-material interaction, and hand-eye coordination. This systematic review informs future endeavors in theorizing a digital learning framework that can integrate computational thinking into early childhood education.

AB  - Teacher competencies encompass the dimensions of knowledge and attitudes, yet few studies have analysed teachers' latent profiles in relation to the interaction between these two dimensions. Latent profile analysis, which examines the interplay between variables to distinguish subgroups of individuals, has recently emerged in studies of computational thinking (CT) as a method for identifying student profiles. However, the latent profiles of CT teachers have not yet been analysed. We therefore analysed the latent profiles of a sample of 493 teachers who had participated in a teacher development programme in CT, according to their knowledge and perceived usefulness of CT. Three profiles were identified: (1) highly knowledgeable with high perceived usefulness, (2) knowledgeable with low perceived usefulness, and (3) less knowledgeable with low perceived usefulness. Qualitative data further triangulated these findings. We also examined the learning achievement of 12,105 students taught by these teachers. Students taught by highly knowledgeable teachers with a high perceived sense of usefulness demonstrated significantly better achievement than their peers. Our findings highlight the importance of nurturing both knowledge of and perceived usefulness in CT. They also provide valuable insights for similar teacher development programmes, emphasizing the importance of peer mentoring support for less knowledgeable teachers. Additionally, we underscore the value of having teachers create artefacts using CT for instructional purposes, allowing them to gain firsthand experience of its usefulness. As few studies have explored teachers' latent profiles based on the dimensions of knowledge and attitudes, the contribution of this study extends beyond the domain of CT.

AB  - We designed a controlled trial protocol that seeks to contribute to cognitive science by studying the effect of thought training on children's executive functions. The study design is a cluster randomized controlled trial, with intra-subject and inter-subject evaluation, with two parallel groups: an experimental group and a TAU control group. With three measures, pre-test, post-test, and follow-up after three months. The participants will be children aged 9 to 11. The allocation will be randomized by groups and not individually. The sample will be a minimum of 44 participants. The primary measures will be neuropsychological tests to assess executive functions. Secondary measures will be a computational thinking test, neuropsychological tests to assess metacognition and attention, and an acceptability scale. The experimental group will participate in the COGNI-MACHINE computational thinking training designed by the first author. The training frequency will be twice a week in 60 min sessions for 12 weeks. The TAU control group will receive computer science classes as usual during the same time as the experimental group. The evaluators taking the measurements will be blinded to the assignment. The investigators in charge of the intervention will be blinded to the results of the evaluations.

AB  - Negative feedback can temporarily relieve negative Chinese transfer (NCT) in English as a foreign language (EFL) syntactic writing by focusing only on the surface writing constructs, neglecting that EFL writing is an embodiment of the process by which higher-order thinking operates. To solve the problem, the researchers conducted a pretest, interventionist group dynamic assessment (IGDA) in the form of negative feedback based on computational thinking (CT), higher-order thinking, and post-test quasi-experimental design, with a control group receiving the direct correction feedback instructing model to mitigate the NCT in EFL syntactic writing. We analyzed the syntactic writing types and frequencies of the NCT obtained through repeated-measure ANOVA and confirmed by qualitative data through video recording. The results indicated that IGDA in the form of negative feedback based on CT principal skills could (1) significantly decrease syntactic writing errors caused by the NCT, (2) improve learners’ EFL writing performance, and finally, (3) elevate the computer as an essential mediation tool. This innovative instructing mode of intervening with writing constructs and higher-order thinking and bringing about deeper thinking and creativity contributes to the EFL writing teaching methodology in a foreign language higher education.

AB  - The tenure system in the United States places significant importance on teaching effectiveness. To date, students' evaluations of teaching (SETs) have been the reigning mechanism for assessing effective teaching. However, prior work has shown that SETs are often biased against underrepresented groups and minorities. The present study analyzes options for effective teaching assessments, which include evaluating final grades and measuring the differences between students’ pre- and post-tests (normalized gain) using standard instruments. The content area and the instrument used in this study originated in the computational thinking field, which has a widespread presence in engineering, where minorities are at a disadvantage. This study obtained a total of 88 student participants from four sections of an introductory engineering course at a Southwestern institution. The study utilized a computational thinking diagnostic (CTD) to inform the course teaching approach (the intervention). Results show that (a) normalized learning gains correlated moderately with SETs, (b) final grades correlated strongly with SETs, (c) final grades correlated strongly with normalized learning gains, (d) the educational intervention based on the CTD significantly affected student learning, and (e) SET comments affect evaluations. The implications include the notion that standardized instrument-driven instruction and evaluations can increase the success of minorities on both sides of the classroom. The purpose of this manuscript is to invite the Heliyon readership to get involved in the development of related instruments and to incorporate these measures of learning into their instruction so biases are avoided or minimized.

AB  - In the digital age, our lives become more dependent on technology, yet the digital gap is intensifying especially because most people lack digital literacy. As a modest step to handle this challenge, we designed a course named "Play with me in Code" to develop pre-service teachers' (PSTs) thinking skills and expose them to learning by creation using computational thinking and programming as part of the constructionism paradigm. The added value of using Scratch in the context of teacher education lies not only in familiarity with a programming language but with an emphasis on experiencing self-directed learning tackling with problem solving situations, creativity, socioemotional competencies, and logical computational thinking. The present study aims to examine 25 PSTs' attitudes towards facing challenges of coding with Scratch. To this end, a mixed-method approach was activated by using questionnaires, blog posts, and reflections. Findings revealed that the learning environment encouraged PSTs' use of abstraction and decomposition to address a complex problem or to design a complex game. Study's conclusions relate to the importance of providing PSTs opportunities to experience learning by programming for raising their awareness of the importance of enhancing thinking skills and creativity in the future.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT), a way to think about solving problems, is recognized as a basic skill for the 21st century. Although game-based learning (GBL) has been shown to improve student's CT skills, students may fail to self-evaluate or debate as they play games, thus failing to develop higher-order thinking. Also not widely explored is how teachers are to practice the CT core competencies during the learning process to cultivate students' problem-solving thinking. As the adoption of student-generated questions (SGQ) is an instructional strategy to promote higher-order thinking, we develop a GBL platform that uses this strategy to enhance students' CT skills, learning motivation, and learning confidence. For this purpose, fifty-three primary school students were recruited for this study, and data were collected during four classes of experimental CT activities. This study shows that the experimental group using the SGQ strategy with a GBL platform exhibited significantly higher CT skills than the control group. In addition, with respect to learning motivation and learning confidence it is found that the experimental group also outperformed the control group. This confirms that integrating the SGQ strategy and CT core competencies fosters higher-order cognitive thinking in students in problem-solving through gamification of the learning environment, resulting in higher motivation and confidence to complete experimental activities.

AB  - To effectively utilize artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies such as ChatGPT and realize their novel ethical issues, individuals must have a variety of knowledge and skills about AI. Such knowledge and skills have led to the emergence of AI literacy. Despite the importance of AI literacy in everyday life, little is known about its determinants. To better understand the determinants of AI literacy, we attempted to build a research model relying on previous research and different theoretical frameworks. The model incorporated digital divide, cognitive absorption, and computational thinking. As a major finding from the current study, computational thinking was found to be a significant determinant of AI literacy, which facilitate using, recognizing, and evaluating AI-based technologies. Moreover, we found out that individuals with physical access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) are more expected to use and recognize AI. Also, motivation and skills in using ICTs enable individuals to better evaluate the outcomes of AI-based technologies. The findings also showed that convenient access to ICTs contributes to a deep involvement with AI-based technologies in the use. Further, individuals with higher motivation and skills to use AI technologies are likely to have a pleasant experience after using these technologies.

AB  - Both computational thinking (CT) and creativity have been recognized as key skills for today's learners. Over the last decade, research of both skills in a single context has emerged. In this paper, we present a scoping review of 62 such empirical from 2011 to 2020. Our goal was to have a thorough understanding of the educational settings in which research on both CT and creativity was conducted, the theoretical foundations it has laid down, and the research tools used. Our findings indicate a geographical bias (dominance of the US and prominence of developed European countries), as well as a focus on secondary education and on STEM-related disciplines; this could be explained by the current situation of CT spread. We also found that when studying CT and creativity jointly, it is most common to define CT in a broader perspective than merely programming of computer science. Additionally, while creativity is largely referred to as product-related, CT is barely referred to as such. Taken together, our findings point out some gaps in the current research of CT and creativity and suggest how it should be expended on the fertile grounds of creativity, as the latter crosses geographical, age, and subject borders. Doing so may build a bridge between CT and creativity in a way that will benefit both.

AB  - This paper sheds light on 3–5-year-old children’s enactments of computational empowerment (CE) in activities with computational thinking (CT). CT is widely elaborated on as a universal problem-solving approach and a skill set necessary for thriving in today’s digitized societies. Scholars claim that CT for all should be ensured from an early age, and several studies develop and examine age-appropriate technological tools, as well as pedagogical approaches, for young children’s learning of CT. Based on 1.5 years of co-designing for children’s situated CT in two Danish kindergartens, the present study conducts a socioculturally informed analysis of video-observed interactions between children and educational robots. The findings display how children and robots engage in interactions that transcend children’s mastery of CT in any narrow sense. This is examined as situated enactments of CE; as children’s critical and informed decisions regarding the roles that technologies, in this case educational robots, can play in their institutionally situated social lives. The paper concludes that children’s various enactments of CE deserve scholarly and professional attention, both as an important prerequisite for, and as a necessary limitation to, the implementation of CT in kindergartens.

AB  - Since the end of the 20th century, the digitalization of society, including the educational systems, has been growing exponentially. At the same time, education systems have been evolving towards competency-based assessment. Likewise, at the beginning of this century, the idea of Computational Thinking was resurrected by J. Wing, for solving problems and designing systems using concepts of computer science. Today, we can see how all these questions are taking shape in a new competence, called Computational Thinking, related to others that already exist. In this paper, we have studied the skills of Computational Thinking in university students, focusing on abstraction and its possible relationship with other factors. Results conclude that the students fail in relation to abstraction and in algorithmic thinking. Although the ability of abstraction is not easy to measure, a linear regression analysis has been carried out in order to determine its possible study.

AB  - Teaching computational thinking (CT) has become a priority for educators and policymakers tasked with educating and training students for future jobs which are predicted to be increasingly automated. Recent research on effective instructional interventions for developing computational thinking skills, including algorithmic and critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity, and cooperativity, suggests that teaching and learning CT can improve student academic performance. In fact, the extant literature is quite sanguine about the topic of CT. However, few studies have attempted to establish a relationship between CT skills and academic performance. In the present cross-sectional study, we employ path analysis to model the structural relationship between self-reported CT skills and academic performance of a sample of 81 computer science undergraduates enrolled at a Southwestern American university. We found few direct relationships between CT skills and academic performance. We only find a significant positive relationship between creativity and academic performance and a significant negative relationship between cooperativity and academic performance. Our findings are surprising considering the abundant research promoting computational thinking as a key component of 21st century skills. The findings call for further in-depth analysis of computational thinking and the influence on students’ learning and learning outcomes. We discuss our results with respect to recent educational mandates for including CT and instructional alignment in school curricula. Our findings contribute to the existing discussion by helping to clarify the relationship between CT skills and academic performance in higher education.

AB  - Although studies have shown that computational thinking (CT) can enhance learning processes and outcomes across traditional subjects, they have not shown how teachers might scaffold children's CT processes in a technology-mediated learning context. This exploratory study examined how teacher talk and technologies impacted the CT of three children (6 to 8 years old). Seven videotaped 90-minute sessions of weekly project-based activities yielded 4,842 turns of talk (2,974 by children). Statistical discourse analysis revealed the following results. After a teacher command, the children more often executed a sequence of actions toward a solution but less often demonstrated problem understanding than otherwise. Following a teacher's open question, the children were more likely to offer logically organized ideas. In response to a teacher's rhetorical question, they more often searched for information. These results inform educators regarding when to use each type of teacher talk to scaffold children's CT processes.

AB  - ChatGPT (generative pre-trained transformer) is one of the artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that have started to be used in programming education. However, the effect of using ChatGPT in programming education on learning processes and outcomes is not yet known. This study investigated the effect of programming education using the ChatGPT on students' computational thinking skills, programming self-efficacy, and motivation toward the lesson. The research was conducted on 45 undergraduate students who took a university-level programming course. The research was carried out according to the experimental design with the pretest-posttest control group. Students were randomly divided into experimental (n = 21) and control (n = 24) groups. While the experimental group students benefited from the ChatGPT during the weekly programming practices, the control group students did not use this tool. Research data were obtained through the computational thinking scale, computer programming self-efficacy scale, and learning motivation in computer programming courses scale. Research findings revealed that the experimental group students' computational thinking skills, programming self-efficacy, and motivation for the lesson were significantly higher than the control group students. In line with this result, it can be said that it may be useful to benefit from AI technologies such as ChatGPT in programming trainings. The research findings, it was emphasized how the most effective use of AI support in the lessons could be made, and various suggestions were made for researchers and educators in this regard.

AB  - In this paper, we explore how the theoretical notion of possibility space offers a way to study how children's computational thinking develops as a process. Drawing on embodied notions of cognition, we first examine the literature that supports how children's computational thinking emerges as a possibility space that involves conceptualizing possible actions in a given moment, deciding which action to take by anticipating the results of a possible action, and learning from the actions that they have taken. We then use a grounded approach to analyze the problem-solving process of two 5th-grade children who engaged in an educational robotics activity over two 50-minute class periods. The findings lend support for approaching children's computational thinking as a cycle of action-taking that includes conceptualizing, anticipating, and taking action. The findings also support the pedagogical practice of having children predict the results of a computer program to enhance their computational thinking. Implications for the way that teachers can support children in learning to conceptualize what is possible and take action from it are discussed.

AB  - Predictive learner modelling is crucial for personalized education. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great success in education, their potential in learner modelling via image data is unexplored. This research introduces a novel and interpretable approach for Image-based Learner Modelling (ImageLM) using CNNs and transfer learning to model learners’ performance and accordingly classify their computational thinking solutions. The approach integrates Grad-CAM, enabling it to provide insights into its decision-making process. Findings show that our custom CNN outperforms other models (namely ResNet, VGG, and Inception), with 83% accuracy in predicting solution correctness. More importantly, the ImageLM approach identifies the regions that contribute the most to the predictions, shedding light on learners' computational thinking knowledge and advancing toward trustworthy AI for education. These results underline the potential of utilizing imagery data from learners’ activities during the learning process to predict their performance, especially in challenging environments like programming where traditional feature extraction and learning might struggle.

AB  - The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has led to the proliferation of computational thinking (CT) education. However, research on unplugged activities’ influence in elementary math classrooms is limited, despite some exploring programming's cognitive benefits. This study presents both qualitative and quantitative analyzes stemming from a ten-week quasi-experimental research endeavor, specifically tailored for third-grade students. The research devised a series of unplugged activities, encompassing mathematical games, hands-on construction of mathematical logic boards, and calculating shopping discounts. The overarching objective was to investigate the impact of these unplugged activities on students’ mathematical creativity and CT. Students participating in a mathematics curriculum based on unplugged activities (N = 47) were compared with students participating in a traditional lecture-based mathematics curriculum (N = 46). The results indicated that unplugged activities exhibited significant advantages in fostering students’ CT and mathematical creativity across three dimensions, namely, problem-posing creativity (t = 5.830, p < 0.01), problem-solving creativity (t = 6.633, p < 0.01), and creative self-efficacy (t = 7.554, p < 0.01). Furthermore, the study revealed a relationship between students’ mathematical creativity as a predictor of CT. The results of the quantitative analysis were supported by the teacher's and students’ interview data, and the students felt excited and interested in the unplugged activities, whereas some students using the lecture-based method reported boredom and lack of interactivity. This research offered valuable insights for mathematics and CT education practice, underscoring unplugged activity as an innovative instructional approach that brings forth new possibilities for traditional mathematics teaching, with potential applications in the K-12 curriculum.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has received worldwide attention due to its alignment with developing 21st century skills such as creativity, problem-solving, and digital competence. With the increasing provision of programming tools such as robotic toys and tablet apps in the sector of early childhood education (ECE), many ECE researchers and practitioners tend to link CT to programming. However, children are reluctant to sustain their interests in programming activities, and may be further demotivated by debugging failures. This multi-group quasi-experimental study aimed to evaluate the effects of a story-inspired approach in bridging the gap between programming and CT for preschool children. Building on previous literature suggesting storytelling as a powerful, culturally responsive pedagogy, 5-year-old children (N=108) were involved in nine weeks of CT learning via one of the three conditions: Story-Inspired Robot Programming (SIRP), Story-Inspired Tablet Programming (SITP), and unplugged CT education. Results revealed that children who participated in the SIRP and SITP conditions showed improved CT scores, relative to unplugged CT education, even after controlling for baseline CT scores. No gender or family socioeconomic effects were found to influence the benefits of story-inspired programming interventions. These findings suggest that storytelling as a culturally responsive approach, whether using robots or tablets as a programming tool, can provide young children with more inclusive and sustainable CT learning experiences.

AB  - Content area K-12 teachers are increasingly asked to integrate computing and computational thinking into their classrooms, yet they often have little experience with computing. The purpose of this study was to understand how science teachers, new to computing and integrating computational thinking into their classrooms, supported students as computational problem solvers. In the project from which this research was drawn, 8th grade science teachers in three US school districts integrated computer game design into their study of climate systems and climate change. We conducted participant observation, collected teacher implementation logs and interviewed 15 teachers engaged in the three-year design research project, Building Systems from Scratch. Analysis through grounded theory yielded several results related to teachers’ orientations, strategies, and use of resources to create systems of distributed expertise. We identified five major themes: a) releasing responsibility to students, b) co-learning with students, c) encouraging students’ independent problem solving, d) building interdependence among students, and e) providing multiple other resources. Findings are discussed in relation to the literature on integrating computational thinking into content area classrooms.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is currently used as an umbrella term in education to describe the processes associated with learning and applying computer science concepts and strategies for problem-solving. Despite a growing body of literature on the subject within education and the development of a grand variety of tools designed to enhance computational thinking abilities, the relations between CT and other cognitive abilities have not been reported in young children. Understanding CT from a cognitive development perspective could be useful for creating targeted interventions tailored for young children. In the present study, we compare a previously reported computational thinking assessment with a battery of nine cognitive tests, which include fluid intelligence, working memory, planning, sequencing, mental rotation, vocabulary, and early math precursors such as numerical transcoding and symbolic magnitude comparison. Mixed-effects linear regressions were implemented with CT as a dependent variable to explore the associations between our variables. A subsample of children who participated in an educational robotics intervention were assessed in their robot programming performance, and its outcomes were compared with their CT assessments. Results suggest temporal sequencing ability and symbolic magnitude comparison are significant predictors of CT in kindergarten. Positive significant associations between robot programming and CT performance are reported.

AB  - The research aims to evaluate the effect of a robotics-based computational thinking program on executive functions and visuospatial skills in preschool children. Additionally, the study will explore the relationship between these three variables and early experiences with toys. The study will be a cluster-randomized controlled trial with pre- and post-intervention measures. Participants will be preschool children aged 5 to 6 years from both public and private institutions. The intervention will involve a new educational robotics device called ROVERSA and will consist of eight sessions distributed over four weeks, with the experimental group placed on a waitlist. To assess executive functions and visuospatial skills, standardized and validated neuropsychological measures will be used, including the Flanker task, the NIH Toolbox Card Sorting Test, the Corsi Block Test, the NEPSY-II Mental Rotation Test, the Pyramid of Mexico from the ENI-2 battery, and the Computational Thinking Test (CTt). Data analysis will begin with a hypothesis tested through ANOVA-MR, and linear regressions will be implemented to assess the relationship between variables. It is expected that the results will contribute to the discussion on teaching computational thinking and educational robotics as early learning experiences and their impact on the cognitive development of children.

AB  - This study examined the impact of a 10-month STEM professional development (PD) program on 25 teachers working with gifted students. The program aimed to enhance pedagogical knowledge and competencies. Findings indicated significant positive improvements in teachers' STEM self-efficacy, computational thinking, and entrepreneurship skills. The PD program also had a direct positive influence on the quality of lesson plans. The study suggests that effective PD design should incorporate scientific inquiry, engineering design processes, computational thinking, entrepreneurship skills, and the development of teachers' self-efficacy for successful implementation of PD outcomes in STEM education.

AB  - Educators emphasize that computational thinking is especially helpful in raising problem-solving skills, improving logical reasoning, and developing analytical thinking. In this context, the aim of this study is to develop an online, interactive, valid, reliable and useful performance-based assessment tool for measuring computational thinking skills. Data were collected in two stages with three different measurement tools. In the data collection phase, a psychometric scale, a skill test and an interactive web application developed in this study were used. In the study in which a total of 203 high school students participated, it was determined that the students' computational thinking skills were at average level. as a result, a valid and reliable performance-based platform was developed for measuring computational thinking skills. It has also been concluded that the performance-based measurement tool makes a better measurement than the psychometric scale. It is emphasized that computational thinking should be treated as a skill or group of skills, not as a theoretical knowledge, product/portfolio or attitude/perception. Therefore, it is believed that developing performance-based tools for evaluating computational thinking skills and measuring them by using multiple measurement tools will give more accurate results. Considering the developments in computational thinking, it is thought that the study will contribute to the literature.

AB  - Computing education has progressively entered into children's early years. Due to a proliferation of computing education programs and coding tools designed for young children, research on the relationships between computational thinking (CT) and other domains of learning and development is highly warranted. Yet, there is little empirical evidence that shows the relationship between CT and children's overall cognitive functioning. As such, this study explored the relationships between Chinese children's CT and their sequencing ability and self-regulation in early childhood. One hundred and one Chinese young children (Ngirl = 52 and Nboy = 49; Mage = 5.25, SD = 0.73) were recruited and evaluated with three reliable instruments. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that: (1) CT positively predicted sequencing ability (β = 0.27, p < .05) even after controlling for relevant demographic covariates such as age, gender, and family socioeconomic status; (2) CT positively predicted self-regulation (β = 0.47, p < .001) after controlling for demographic covariates. Our findings suggest that CT may be a domain-general ability that is based on cognitive foundations that extend beyond the realm of computing.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is regarded as the conceptual basis required for identifying and solving real-world problems through algorithmic approaches to achieve transferable solutions. Developing students' CT in primary school stages is essential and has received considerable attention. Meanwhile, researchers incorporated digital badges into classrooms to improve students' learning motivation in computer science (CS). However, few solid empirical studies analyze the effects of the digital badges approach in CS education to develop students' CT. Therefore, to bridge this gap, this study designed and implemented a block-based programming course in a primary school and examined the impact of the digital badges approach on pupils' CT skills and self-efficacy and learning motivation in CS. A quasi-experimental design was conducted among 99 third-grade students across three classes. The results revealed that the adapted digital badges in primary school (1) significantly improved the students' CT skills, (2) had no significant positive impact on their CT self-efficacy or learning motivation in CS, and (3) showed no mediating effect of learning motivation on the relationship between CT skills and CT self-efficacy. In addition, we found that whether students could see only their own digital badges or also those of others had no impact on CT skills, self-efficacy, or learning motivation in CS. These findings have implications for the design of digital badge educational interventions intended to promote students' CT and learning motivation.

AB  - Computational thinking refers to a series of cognitive processes involved in solving problems through computational systems. A growing body of studies has managed to demonstrate the correlation between computational thinking and different cognitive domains. In recent decades, multiple studies have taken place that seek to evaluate the effect of computational thinking on higher-order cognitive processes. The current study aims to contribute to this discussion by analyzing the effect of an intervention program in computational thinking on the executive functions of school-age children. In this experimental study, 30 children aged 10 and 11 were randomly assigned to an experimental group and an active control group. The instruments to collect the data were 15 tests of the neuropsychological battery of executive functions and frontal lobes BANFE-2, which were applied to both groups before and after the intervention. The experimental group participated in an 8-week computational thinking intervention during which its participants enrolled in plugged and unplugged activities and carried out block programming language twice a week. The results showed that the intervention had significant effects on executive functions associated with the anterior prefrontal cortex and the dorsolateral cortex, but not those related to the orbitofrontal area.

AB  - Learning coding during early childhood is an effective way for children to practice computational thinking. Aspects of children's motivation can increase the likelihood that children approach computational thinking activities with enthusiasm and deep engagement. Gender inequities may interfere with children's readiness to take advantage of opportunities to build computational thinking skills through activities such as coding. Societal stereotypes can reduce young girls’ motivation to engage with computer science, preventing them from gaining benefits from coding activities designed to support computational thinking. This study examined children's gender stereotypes as well as children's own motivation for computer coding in 363 first- through third-grade children. We assessed gender differences in both stereotypes and motivation, as well as links between the stereotypes that individual children held and their own motivation. Children generally endorsed stereotypes about interest and ability for computer coding that favored their own-gender group, although third-grade girls reported gender-egalitarian beliefs about interest in coding. There were no gender differences in children's motivation for computer coding in terms of their own interest, sense of belonging, or ability self-concepts. Children's stereotypes about their own-gender group were significantly positively correlated with their own motivation for computer coding. These findings suggest that early childhood represents an excellent age for children to begin building computational thinking skills, before girls endorse negative stereotypes about their gender's interest in computer science.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is an essential skill students need if they are to adapt to the rise of digital society, and the evaluation of CT is crucial for enhancing students’ CT. However, the current evaluation of CT is based on a summative paradigm and ignores real CT performance during the assessment process. This study thus used a multimodal cognitive diagnostic model (H-MCDM) of students’ CT based on multimodal data in situational tasks, to achieve precise evaluation and explore the current mastery status of students’ CT and their cognitive and behavioral characteristics. The research results indicate that: 1) students’ CT was at a moderately high level and indicated a good grasp of the CT components of problem decomposition and algorithm design, but students had not yet mastered problem abstraction, 2) a total of six different CT latent patterns were discerned in the overall student results, 3) individual students who shared the same CT latent patterns could differ in their cognitive and behavioral characteristics, while those with different CT latent patterns could share similar characteristics. This study showed that it is possible to capture the degree of students’ mastery of CT and their cognitive and behavioral differences with the same or different CT latent patterns at a granular level, providing a basis for developing individualized strategies to enhance students’ CT.

AB  - In-service elementary school teachers need training to teach computational thinking (CT). A common model for CT professional learning programs includes an initial workshop followed by ongoing support. However, little research has examined the efficacy of ongoing support, the most effective types, and its impact on classroom practices. The current study details a multifaceted CT professional learning program with innovative ongoing support to help elementary school teachers implement the Code.org curriculum. It also empirically investigated the impact of the support on teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT, the effectiveness of each component of the support, and to what extent it affected teachers' classroom practices. Our ongoing support included an additional workshop, grade-level professional learning community (PLC) sessions, instructional videos, and teacher leaders' support. Data included a pre-survey, four post-surveys, lesson observations, a focus group interview, tracking the number of video views, and surveys from PLC participants and teacher leaders. Results indicated that the ongoing support significantly increased teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT. Regarding the effectiveness of the various components of the ongoing support, the additional workshop significantly increased teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT. Teachers valued each component of the support, and this support improved teachers’ classroom practices.

AB  - The present study investigates the debugging process of 526 children in preschool (4–6 aged) when programming a tangible robot. When a child is involved in programming, it is needed to identify and correct errors, or in other words, debug a program. Debugging is a high-level thinking skill and is an essential component closely related to developing Computational Thinking in early childhood education. Though the debugging process is a cognitive function in programming investigated by many researchers in recent decades, most studies are conducted either in primary, secondary education, or higher education concerning beginners or experts in programming. Very few reviews, and some focus on preschool education. Our study set out the following objectives: 1) How do children identify the existence of error and locate it? 2) What types of errors emerge when coding? 3) What type of error is complex for novice programmers? 4) What strategies are developed by novice programmers to debug effectively? and 5) What types of knowledge do novice programmers construct by debugging the tangible robot Bee-Bot? The study follows an iterative model of a design-based research approach. It uses multiple case studies to collect qualitative and quantitative data. The programming intervention was implemented by 30 educators in their classrooms and was based on a scenario-based teaching design. The debugging process was analysed using Klahr & Craven's framework (1988): 1) test and evaluate program, 2) identify bug, 3) represent program, 4) locate bug and 5) correct bug. The main finding is the construction and development of syntactic and semantic knowledge.

AB  - A plethora of programming platforms purports to teach preschool-aged children computational thinking (CT) and coding skills. However, the empirical evidence to support their effectiveness is still in its early stages. A three-week didactic intervention using ScratchJr was conducted to investigate its effectiveness in fostering CT and rudimentary coding skills in a cohort of preschool children (N = 34, aged 4–6 years). While the initial performance mean of the control group (M = 7.07, SD = 2.58) exhibits a statistically significant elevation t (22.64 = 2.23, p = 0.036) vis-à-vis the experimental group (M = 5.35, SD = 1.58), t (22.64) = 2.23, p = 0.0 the terminal performance means of both groups converge closely. However, meticulous data analysis unveils a statistically notable enhancement among preschool participants exposed to the educational intervention involving ScratchJr. Notably, both instructional modalities appear commensurate in nurturing elementary computational tenets, namely modularity and control structures. The experimental cohort outperforms the control group with statistical significance in comprehending potent ideational constructs encompassing representation, algorithms, and hardware/software interplay. Conversely, the control group performs better in grasping the debugging concept than their experimental counterparts. The outcomes lend substantive credence to the efficacy of the distinct programming milieu offered by ScratchJr, underscoring its effectiveness in cultivating CT and coding proficiencies within the preschool demographic.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is crucial for students. Robot-supported learning has emerged as a popular approach for CT cultivation. To understand the effects of robot-supported CT cultivation, the current study conducted a meta-analysis to analyze studies from Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Science Direct databases (2012–2022) which screened using keywords ``computational thinking'' and ``robot''. After further screening, 26 peer-reviewed articles were selected. We synthesized the 33 effect sizes to assess the overall effectiveness of robot-supported learning on CT and its sub-dimensions: concepts, practices, and perspectives. Our findings revealed a medium effect of robot-supported learning on students' CT (g = 0.643), a large effect on CT concepts (g = 0.650), a medium effect on CT practices (g = 0.587), and a huge effect on CT perspectives (g = 1.419). We also explored the moderators (i.e., grade level, study duration, culture, learning strategy, and assessment tool) that might influence the effects of robot-supported CT cultivation. Moderator analyses indicated that short-term (less than four weeks) robot-supported learning had a larger effect (g = 0.901) on CT practice than long-term (more than eleven weeks) learning (g = 0.309). This meta-analysis indicates that educators could apply robot-supported learning to cultivate students' CT and concludes with related implications.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has gained increasing recognition as a 21st-century competency. Although initiatives have been taken to define the term for educational practices, limited empirical evidence is available to clarify its underlying components, especially at the primary education level. This study aimed to identify the associations between CT and specific cognitive skills in the primary school context. Based on the literature, three cognitive domains were studied (i.e., mathematical, visuospatial, and reasoning skills) and standard test batteries were applied to a sample of 633 primary students (aged 7–12 years). Linear regression analyses were performed with CT performance as the dependent variable to investigate its associations with the measured cognitive skills, and demographic features (i.e., age, gender) and coding learning experience (i.e., years of coding experience, extra-curricular coding experience) were included as control variables. The results indicated that the students’ CT performance was significantly predicted by their attainments in numeracy, visual perception, spatial visualisation, and inductive reasoning, and the results remained significant after controlling for demographics and coding experience. The study adds to the literature by enriching the understanding of CT as a psychological construct and has practical implications for educational stakeholders regarding the importance of interdisciplinary teaching and the integration of specific cognitive skills into CT learning activities.

AB  - The sustainable and digital future of work may imply a dramatic equilibrium change between social factors and technological ones. We argue that providing suitable tools to support End-User Development (EUD) in the workplace could represent a way to cope with such future changes. The contributions of this paper include the analysis and characterization of the most used EUD techniques and their crossover with a new conveyed model of Computational Thinking. The synthesis between these aspects is made explicit in the construct of EUDability, which is designed to capture the quality dimensions of EUD systems suitable to work scenarios where better roles and better tools for individuals may be shaped. EUDability has to do with identifying and assessing the difficulties of EUD techniques on one side and the Computational Thinking skills held by individuals on the other side.

AB  - There has been an increasing interest in the integration of technology into language education. Meanwhile, computational thinking (CT) skills are fostered which influence communicative language teaching and learning. Despite CT's established importance in science education, its significance in language teaching remains scarce. This study contributes to knowledge synthesis and methodological development by reviewing 16 journal articles, analyzing CT applications in language learning across educational contexts, intervention tools, CT skills, language acquisition, and assessment methods. The results indicate that (a) more CT-involved activities are needed for primary, secondary, and tertiary education, (b) educational robots and Scratch stand out as the most trending intervention tools, (c) CT skills such as decomposition, abstraction, generalization and so on have a positive effect on students’ foreign language acquisition, especially in grammar and writing, (d) assessment of CT development can be surveyed through a validated and reliable instrument such as computer programming self-efficacy scale or an online platform: Dr. Scratch; Conversely, there is a diversity of evaluation tools in foreign language learning. This study is the first to review experimental research on integrating computational thinking into foreign language learning and offers significant implications for future research.

AB  - The development of programming skills and computational thinking in the formal educational context is one of the most recent horizons set by many educational systems worldwide. Although the first computational thinking initiatives are being applied from the earliest school ages, this research focuses on the secondary education level. Specifically, the objective is the following: to analyse the implementation of Arduino, as well as the benefits and opportunities it brings to secondary school students. For this purpose, documentary research has been undertaken applying a systematic review according to the PRISMA 2020 framework following the PiCoS strategy. Atlas.ti 9 was used to analyse the information. Out of 316 papers identified, 37 were included in the research. In relation to the results, Arduino is primarily used in technology and physics subjects, although it is also used to develop interdisciplinary STEAM projects. As a rule, it is used to learn programming languages, but likewise as a resource to develop science experiments. LED lights, servomotors and breadboards are among the most commonly used resources together with the Arduino board. and Scratch was the most widely used software. The initiatives implemented have yielded both positive and negative results, for example, one drawback is that some projects are very difficult, and some achievements such as: increased motivation towards the contents addressed or also the development of some soft skills, such as problem solving.

AB  - Recently, virtual reality (VR) technology has shown great potential in advancing education with many pedagogical benefits for building the 21st-century teaching and learning experience. This study conducted a formative evaluation of an immersive VR expedition application with the aim of understanding users' learning processes and how the application facilitates higher education students' computational thinking skills. Six participants were randomly selected to conduct this evaluation. A mixed research approach consisting of quantitative and qualitative methods was employed. The study quantitatively analyzed users' scores from gameplay to understand how the intervention supported computational thinking skills. Participants were also interviewed to collect data after playing the mini-games to investigate users' experiences. The study showcases players' computational thinking competency, assessed automatically during gameplay. Further, this study used inductive content analysis to demonstrate users' reactions to prototyped VR mini-games. The qualitative findings suggest that users found the VR mini-games interactive and immersive, which provided an opportunity to foster learners' computational thinking skills. The quantitative analysis revealed that student's computational thinking competency can be enhanced through consistent playing of the mini-games. Moreover, the expedition aspect of the VR game stimulated learners' curiosity, which sustained their learning progress. Furthermore, users gained new knowledge and found the mini-games educative. Nevertheless, several aspects of the VR mini-games need improvements, according to users' perceptions. This study contributes to the knowledge in terms of the affordances of VR in education research and provides relevant insights that can shape future studies, for example, the recent hype of metaverse in education.

AB  - Project-Based Learning (PBL) and Computational Thinking (CT), a teaching strategy and a problem-solving method, respectively, have been widely used in teaching and learning because of their educational advantages for students and teachers. However, studies of their integration into the teaching and learning process have been scarce, resulting in a lack of guidance for educators to implement such an approach that apply constructivism learning theory. This study aims to systematically review and identify appropriate frameworks, models, techniques and tools that could guide the successful implementation of PBL-CT. This study examined relevant articles published from 2017 to 2021 to highlight the gaps in the PBL-CT execution and map their backgrounds into a coherent taxonomy that could help guide the directions of future studies. As revealed, none of such articles explicitly explain any suitable PBL-CT frameworks or models. The study identified several common elements for the PBL-CT framework formulation, indicating scaffolding and inquiry are the most commonly applied techniques, with visual tools dominating the PBL-CT implementation. Most articles involved computing, followed by STEM, with a few originating from non-STEM fields. Several important implications could help educators develop an effective PBL-CT course design and provide some guidelines for future research. An effective PBL-CT integration enhances teaching and learning besides improving students' computational thinking skills. Thinking skills are critical 21st-century skills needed for students' success.

AB  - Computational thinking has become an integral component of curricula worldwide, necessitating teachers to develop this competence in their students. To effectively meet these curricular requirements, teachers themselves need a solid foundation of computational thinking content knowledge, which refers to the understanding and skills they possess in this area. However, despite widespread recognition of this need, few studies have rigorously examined teachers' content knowledge in this domain. Addressing this gap requires the development of high-quality measurement tools. This study details the development of an instrument, created as part of the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) 2023 in Flanders, to measure lower secondary school teachers' computational thinking content knowledge in a valid and reliable way. The article first outlines the construction process of the instrument, which involved close collaboration with experts in the field and drew upon the framework of Fraillon et al. (2023). Following this, the instrument's psychometric properties are presented, which include both item-level and overall instrument characteristics. These properties were evaluated using data from a sample of 352 participants, applying both Classical Test Theory and Item Response Theory. The final tool consists of sixteen multiple-choice and short constructed response questions. The results indicate favorable item and overall instrument characteristics, thereby affirming its potential to measure the intended construct in a valid and accurate way.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) skills help students both understand and utilize computing in various domains to cope with the challenges posed by the complex digital world. This study applied mind mapping to programming language instruction in a primary school, and explored the effects of mind mapping on students' CT skills when learning programming with Scratch as a programming tool. Two types of mind mapping, construct-by-self mind mapping (CBS-MM) and construct-on-scaffold mind mapping (COS-MM), were proposed to compare which type is more effective in terms of students' CT skills. Seventy-three public primary school fifth-grade students aged 10 to 11 participated in the study. The CBS group included 33 students learning with the CBS-MM instructional approach, while the COS group comprised 40 students learning with the COS-MM instructional approach. Data were obtained from nine topic Scratch programming assignments and pre- and post-CT skills surveys completed by the two groups. Paired sample t tests were used to analyze whether the two types of mind mapping approach could improve both groups' CT skills. One-way ANCOVA and one-way ANOVA were used to examine the difference in the two groups' CT skills. The results showed that both CBS-MM and COS-MM can improve students' CT skills; however, the COS group students could better improve their CT skills with the assistance of the COS-MM method compared with the CBS group students who learned with the CBS-MM method. The findings of this study can provide some enlightenment for relevant instructors to design instruction and implement programming teaching with different kinds of mind mapping support that facilitates students’ CT.

AB  - The specific mechanisms by which teachers and parents can provide culturally relevant opportunities for computational thinking for racially/ethnically and linguistically diverse groups of preschoolers remain unknown. Accordingly, the purpose of this research is to examine how PreK parent and teacher voice directed efforts to realize a culturally relevant computing program. We drew data sources from a subsample of design-based research meetings in which partners collaborated to co-develop the first iteration of the program. Using qualitative analysis, we examined how parent voice and teacher voice, conceptualized as perspectives and participation, influenced theories of culturally responsive computing and computational thinking in early childhood education and the translation of theory into practice in classroom and home settings. Findings showed that connecting powerful ideas from computational thinking, namely algorithms and problem solving (e.g., debugging), to familiar activities and experiences served as a powerful entry point. Yet, differences arose in how teachers and parents conceptualized culturally relevant computing and made connections to familiar routines. We discuss what can be learned from parent voice in regards to bolstering children's self-expression, access to increasingly complex computational thinking tasks, and opportunities for learning cultural and community values through computing.

AB  - In recent years, the development of computational thinking (CT) has become integral to many school curricula worldwide. This has been associated with calls for computational thinking to be considered a ‘21St Century’ competency, valuable to all students as a transferable process for solving problems and building understanding of human behaviour and systems. However, while computational thinking is a focus of most secondary school computer science curricula, proponents such as Jeanette Wing argue its relevance for younger students, indicating more work must be done investigating its development in early years' education. This study used a structured, problem-based curriculum supported by guided inquiry pedagogy, to explore 6 year old students' learning of basic computational thinking concepts and practices while coding programmable floor robots (Blue-bots and an iPad app). Results indicated improvement across the seven lessons in students' sequencing/algorithm authoring, error correction, and pattern recognition. Furthermore, they revealed evidence of higher order thinking such as identifying patterns in code, and how these can be transferred to help solve problems of different designs. While currently play-based approaches are used to introduce computational thinking concepts and practices in early years' education, results from this study suggest that more structured, problem-based methods should be seriously considered. Results challenge commonly understood developmental theories about what young children can and can't do, contextualised within the field of computer science, and hold implications for early years' teachers' professional knowledge and pedagogy if they are to promote their students' learning in this increasingly important area. Given rapid technological advancements such as artificial intelligence (AI) and increasingly earlier exposure of young children to digitally-mediated information, this study provides support for the earlier and more systematic introduction of basic digital literacy knowledge and skills in early years' education.

In this study, we investigated the robots used, proposed activities, and evaluation processes. We also analyzed research contexts and the stated motivations to conduct the studies. Our review identified characteristics of the robots, such as input and output interfaces, cost, and availability. We also categorized activities considering context, modality of work, type of activities, duration, adults’ role, scaffolding, unplugged activities, explicit debugging, communication and sharing instances, and teaching knowledge from other domains. We analyzed the computational thinking evaluation process looking at types of assessments, asset concepts, and research design. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of existing research, identifies existing gaps, and provides recommendations for future studies.

AB  - The integration of computational thinking (CT) into K-12 education offers substantial potential to improve digital literacy and deepen students’ understanding across various subject areas. By embedding computational procedures and solution-oriented approaches into traditional curricula, students can develop essential skills that are critical for thriving in an increasingly digital world. However, the effective integration of CT into subject-specific learning poses challenges for educators, largely due to a lack of training and experience in implementing interdisciplinary instructional strategies. This study explores the impact of integrating CT into K-12 education through diverse instructional approaches, including modelling, storytelling, and unplugged activities. The research examines how students' subject knowledge, CT concepts, and practices evolved under each CT integration practice, as well as their acceptance toward CT integrated lessons. The study was conducted in different subjects, including language arts, biology, and physics, and at different grade levels. The technology acceptance model was used as a theoretical framework to understand students' adoption towards the different integration practices. The study revealed that different CT integration practices yield varying impacts on students' attitudes, particularly in relation to their prior programming experiences. Namely, primary school students with prior programming experience display a higher behavioural intention due to a lack of early biases toward programming. Conversely, secondary school students, less familiar with interdisciplinary approaches, initially show less enthusiasm for future engagement. These insights underscore the need for tailored instructional strategies that consider students' prior experiences and the broader goal of preparing them to contribute to a technologically driven society.

AB  - As we begin to identify essential skills for the future, there has been an increased focus on how to define and implement computational thinking within education. However, the question of how to engage children with coding activities within the context and limitations of the curriculum remains relatively explored. In our study, a human-centered design approach was followed to guide a small group of children through the co-design, implementation and evaluation of a board game. The board game had two versions: an offline version involving a robotic agent and an online version with its digital equivalent. A mixed-method approach was used to understand and compare levels of engagement, usability, and collaboration in both versions of the game. The tangible aspect of working with a robotic agent in the offline version led to greater levels of motivation and involvement with the game mechanics. Tangible robotics games tend to be more approachable for children. Our study shows that using such games by connecting the mathematics curriculum with coding problems can successfully engage participants in collaborative computational thinking activities. We contribute to the field by providing human-centered guidance for the creation of educational tools to develop computational thinking. Such guidance is not only applicable in technologically rich environments; it can also be applied in educational communities with limited access to technology.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has been relevant in teaching STEM courses, and educators are incorporating both plugged and unplugged CT activities in their modules to prepare new entrants for advanced knowledge. However, additional empirical data are needed to understand how an unplugged activities approach can lead to an improved understanding of CT concepts. Therefore, this study investigates the impact of unplugged activities on novice students' CT skills and unravels the characteristics of students' CT competency from performing unplugged activities. The experimental aspect of this study was conducted with a cohort of 210 students participating in an introductory programming course at a University in Nigeria. A mixed-method research approach and a quasi-experimental design were applied in this study to understand how the unplugged approach in teaching CT could help students improve their CT competency. A paired-sample t-test of familiarity score for each CT concept showed a significant increase in the score before and after the intervention. Furthermore, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was used for topic modeling of the text describing students’ solutions. Topic modeling allows for more insights into the steps taken by the students to solve CT problems. Only 27.62 % of students' solution descriptions contained CT concepts, 56.90 % of the students solved the puzzle with an optimal score, and 72.41 % of students who applied CT concepts of problem abstraction and decomposition were able to solve the puzzle correctly. Indeed, CT unplugged activities significantly increased the number of students who gained CT competency. In addition, this study provides recommendation for computer science educators and highlight future direction.

AB  - Computational thinking is a fundamental competence that is being introduced in K-12 and succeeding curricula worldwide. Despite this huge effort, many computational thinking models in the literature do not explicitly take into consideration the pupils’ age and the developmental nature of computational thinking skills. Furthermore, many existing computational thinking models are focused on the internal thinking processes of the individuals, failing to explicitly consider the situated nature, in terms of social context and artefactual environment, that usually characterise tasks that require computational thinking to be solved. In this paper, we present a framework for the design, realisation, analysis, and assessment of computational thinking activities, called CT-cube. The CT-cube allows to extend existing computational thinking models to consider the life-long development of computational thinking skills in individuals, from childhood to adult age, and to take into consideration the situated nature of computational thinking activities. We use the CT-cube to design an unplugged task, called Cross Array Task (CAT), allowing to assess the algorithmic skills of K-12 pupils and we show how the CT-cube can be used in this case to illustrate the development of this competence along the entire compulsory school path, considering a sample of 109 pupil aged 3 to 16 in Switzerland.

AB  - The current single teaching and assessing modes of English as a foreign language (EFL) grammar in China have caused the disconnect between grammar knowledge and competency with numerous errors in essay writing, somehow ignoring the analysis of learners thinking patterns. To solve the problem, computational thinking (CT), a higher-order thinking in solving problems and optimizing the way to acquire knowledge, was employed in the study. As needed, the experimental group was taught using the CT teaching model following CT principal elements (data analysis, pattern recognition, abstraction, decomposition, and parallelization), while the control group followed the traditional teaching mode. Quantitative and qualitative data were obtained based on the pre-test-post-test, classroom observation, and questionnaire survey. The results show that the grammar application in short essay writing of all the members of the experimental group significantly improved and that higher grammar learning agency and engagement were unfolded to show the changes of thinking patterns. However, not all the members from the control group showed similar results. CT serves as an important social mediation tool in EFL teaching. This study further enriches the teaching modes of grammar and is an effective attempt at introducing CT into learners’ thinking patterns.

AB  - With growing interest in supporting the development of computational thinking (CT) in early childhood, there is also need for new assessments that serve multiple purposes and uses. In particular, there is a need to understand the design of formative assessments that can be used during classroom instruction to provide feedback to teachers and children in real-time. In this paper, we report on an empirical study and advance a new unit of observational analysis for formative assessment that we call an indicator of a knowledge refinement opportunity or as a shorthand, KRO indicators. We put forth a new framework for conceptualizing the design of formative assessments that builds on the Evidence Centered Design framework but centers identification and analysis of indicators of knowledge refinement opportunities. We illustrate a number of key indicators through empirical examples drawn from video recordings of Kindergarten classroom lessons.

AB  - Interest in coding education has exploded in the past five years, especially in elementary and early secondary education. Teachers who are largely new to coding are expected to guide entire student bodies through the fundamentals of coding and computational thinking. But little is known about which coding and computational thinking (CT) concepts teachers feel most comfortable with and which concepts they struggle with. This study describes 127 elementary coding teachers’ changes in their beliefs about teaching coding and CT as they participated in year-long continuous professional development. Novice elementary coding teachers demonstrated most growth in their self-efficacy for teaching sequences, algorithms and loops. They were less secure in their knowledge of conditionals, variables, and functions. For computational thinking, teachers were most confident in their ability to identify patterns, think algorithmically, understand logic, and evaluate outcomes, showing less growth with decomposition and abstraction.

AB  - This study compares the effects of coding education with educational robot and unplugged coding activities on pre-school students' computational thinking and executive function skills. This study used a pre-test and post-test comparison group quasi-experimental design. The study was conducted in a public kindergarten with 48 pre-school students (24 educational robot- BeeBot® group and 24-unplugged coding group) aged 5-6. The TechCheck-K test was used to measure computational thinking skills, and Executive Functions Battery-Computerized Touch was used to measure executive function skills. The process started with pre-test applications and ended with post-tests after four weeks (16 different sessions) of the implementation in both groups. The study found a statistically significant difference between the computational thinking pre-test and post-test scores of pre-school students in both groups in favor of the post-test. It was determined that there was a statistically significant difference in favor of the educational robot group between the post-test scores of computational thinking skills. In addition, when the findings regarding executive functions were evaluated, there was a statistically significant difference between the pre-test and post-test scores of total executive function in favor of the post-test in both groups. However, it was observed that there was no statistically significant difference between the post-test scores of both groups in terms of total executive function skills scores. In addition, when the post-test scores of pre-school students in two groups were evaluated, it was determined that there was no significant difference in computational thinking and executive function skills according to gender. Consequently, it was determined that coding education with an educational robot was more effective for gaining computational thinking skills than unplugged coding activities for pre-school students. However, it was observed that there was no difference between the two groups in terms of the development of executive function skills in pre-school education.

AB  - Since environmental and energy issues and challenges continues to emerge as key global concerns, Green Building Certification Systems are becoming increasingly relevant in the construction industry. In this regard, LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is considered one of the most widely recognized environmental assessment methods used globally in the construction industry today. However, due to the high level of complexity of the LEED system, the tools usually used to verify the achievement of the credits lack of “design friendliness” and hardly communicate effectively with the conventional tools used by architects and engineers (e.g. CAD, BIM). This makes difficult to fully take into account, especially at the early design stage, the many interconnected aspects that contribute to the green certification, with consequent issues often arising in the design validation and/or construction phases, resulting in time delays and cost increments. The application of innovative problem-solving methods, such as computational thinking, together with coding techniques, represents an effective way to deal with this issue. This kind of methodology, in fact, allows the requirements of a specific LEED credit to be digitally parametrised and flexibly incorporated into a “designer friendly” working environment. In particular, Visual Programming Languages (VPLs), due to their high simplicity of usage, allow architects and engineers to develop algorithms and thus implement their technical knowledge in the field of environmental design with computer programming skills, useful to improve their tools and keep them constantly updated. The aim of this paper is to illustrate a methodology through which, by merging computational thinking strategies with VPL tools, is possible to keep under control, in the same working environment, all the parameters required to verify in real time the achievement of LEED credits. To demonstrate the flexibility of the approach, dedicated tools developed for the verification of some specific credits at different scales – neighbourhood and building – are illustrated as operational examples of the proposed methodology.

AB  - Computational thinking, defined by Wing (2011) as the “thought processes involved in formulating problems … so that the solutions are represented in a form that can effectively be carried out by an information-processing agent,” has become the central construct of K12 computing education around the world. This article provides a history of computational thinking, a summary of computational thinking's role in educational policy and practice, role as a research construct, and concludes by considering the future of computational thinking. The debate over how to define and teach computational thinking can be understood as a proxy for the broader questions about education.

AB  - Collecting and organizing data to understand and answer real-world questions is an increasingly important skill in our current world. Fostering data collection and analysis (DCA) skills in young children leverages key mathematics skills as well as the data representation, visualization, and interpretation skills of computational thinking (CT), culminating in a problem-solving approach with data. As such, the intervention, comprising investigations and a digital app, supported preschool teachers and children to answer data-focused questions by engaging in each step of the DCA process in order to foster CT and math skills. Teachers appreciated that the app offers a new way for children to visualize data and noted that the app provided learning opportunities for children that would not otherwise be possible or easy to implement. Results also suggest that the app provides a systematic process for data collection, entry, and interpretation. Children in classrooms that completed the intervention had significantly higher scores at post-intervention compared to children in classrooms that did not complete the intervention, controlling for pre-intervention scores, B(SE) = 0.13(0.05), t (6) = 2.48, p = .048.

AB  - Computational Thinking (CT), the conceptual foundations required for solving complex problems effectively and efficiently, is an imperative skill for today's learners, across disciplines and across ages. As for its importance in the wide network of digital literacies, CT has been implemented in various educational contexts, however mostly via digital artifacts, specifically in programming-related activities. This approach does not fulfill the potential of such integration for promoting learning. In this paper, we argue that digital literacies should not be bound to the digital realm, and present a novel approach to fully integrate CT into learning and teaching by the development of CT-infused “unplugged” pedagogical tools that are fully embedded in the subject matter. We demonstrate the advantages to student learning of these tools in two case studies from K-12 mathematics education: 1) An assistive tool for function investigation in high-school calculus – in this case, we point out to how CT skills that were implemented in the tool promoted students' problem solving; 2) A teaching unit for pattern sequences in elementary school – in this case, we show how students in the CT research group outperformed students in the other groups, and how they implemented CT to solve pattern sequence problems effectively and efficiently. We highlight that besides enhancing learning, this approach can help address the important issue of equity in education, and suggest ways to promote it via dedicated professional development.

AB  - Creativity and Computational Thinking (CT) have been pointed out as two important skills that would promote students in the digital age as contributing members of society. Therefore, these two constructs have been extensively researched in recent years, but the associations between them are yet to be fully understood. This study takes another step towards bridging this gap by examining the association between CT and three types of creativity, i.e., Figural Creative Thinking, Verbal Creative Thinking, and Computational Creativity. Data was collected from 119 ninth-grade students (14–15 years old) from Israel. Students took two commonly used creativity tests (Torrance's Test of Creative Thinking, and the Alternative Uses Test). They also used Kodetu—an online learning environment for CT—and we used the system log files to measure their CT acquirement and their computational creativity. Findings suggest some nuanced associations between the four sets of variables. Specifically, we point out the limited associations between verbal and figural creativities, some of which are negative; also, we found that the associations between creative thinking and CT, as well as between creative thinking and computational creativity, differ by gender.

AB  - Many studies have demonstrated that Virtual Exchange (VE) for teaching languages can have a positive effect on learners' intercultural awareness or achievements. However, during this century, the teaching process has shifted from teaching with technology to solving problems with it. In this regard, pedagogical experts in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) have developed programming and robotics based on Computational Thinking skills (CTs), which have been regarded as the core of 21st-century skills. In the field of CALL, this skill has received very little attention. Accordingly, we have attempted to switch the process and outcome of language learning in VE. Thus, we developed the conceptual framework that integrated CTsCALL and Individual-technology-task-environment Fit (ITTEF). Having designed our VE tasks based on CTsCALL, we provided the opportunity for 92 Spanish language learners in our project to exchange language and culture with Cypriot and Irish students and solve VE tasks based on CTsCALL. The result of the symmetric phase of the study validated the five-dimensional structure of CTsCALL and the four-dimensional structures of ITTEF in VE and CALL. It also revealed that language learners, who focused on the key information rather than the details while solving language tasks, as well as recognizing the pattern of task solving and applying them to other tasks, found VE, and CTsCALL to be aligned with their current capabilities, learning environment, and problem-solving skills that mediated their intention to learn and exchange information in this context in the future. Furthermore, the asymmetrical part of the study revealed that sixteen solutions are available to shape language learners' continued intention to use VE by combining the components of CTsCALL and ITTEF. Thus, the study developed the CTsCALL questionnaire and its theory into CALL together with the Council of Europe's Common European Framework of Reference for Languages and recommended that CALL researchers and educators take a broader view of VE, as well as continuing to validate CTsCALL in other CALL disciplines to show that this skill belongs to CALL as well.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is gaining increasing attention from researchers and practitioners all over the world to empower children in the digital era. However, there is no consensus on which components of CT to teach beginning coders in early childhood education (ECE). To address this issue, we conducted a systematic review of 42 empirical studies focused on teaching and assessing CT in ECE. We analyzed the included studies with the three-dimensional CT framework proposed by Brennan and Resnick (2012) and demonstrated how this framework could be modified to fit the context of ECE. Based on this systematic review, we sorted out the CT components that were proven suitable for young children to learn by incorporating emerging components and removing components inappropriate for young children. We thus proposed a CT curriculum framework for ECE that covers CT concepts (i.e., control flow/structures, representation, and hardware/software), CT practices (i.e., algorithmic design, pattern recognition, abstraction, debugging, decomposition, iteration, and generalizing), and CT perspectives (i.e., expressing and creating, connecting, perseverance, and choices of conduct). This systematic review and its associated CT curriculum framework provide important theoretical contributions and practical implications for early childhood CT education.

AB  - In this paper, we review and meta-analyze the findings of experimental studies published between 2006 and 2022 that examined the effects of coding and programming interventions on children's core and higher order executive functions (response inhibition, working memory, cognitive flexibility, planning and problem solving). The systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to address three research questions: 1) Which executive functions are most impacted by the teaching of CT? 2) Which instructional modality (educational robotics/virtual coding/unplugged coding) is most effective in enhancing executive function skills in learners aged 4–16 years? and 3) Does the cognitive effectiveness of coding vary with children's age? A total of 19 studies with 1523 participants met the selection criteria for the systematic review. The meta-analysis included 11 of those studies. The results reveal beneficial effects of structured virtual and tangible coding (educational robotics) activities for preschoolers and first graders, and significant effects of more unstructured virtual coding activities (e.g., Scratch-based) for older students. A multivariate fixed-effects model meta-analysis shows that the teaching of coding significantly improves problem-solving with the highest effect (dppc2 = 0.89), but also planning (dppc2 = 0.36), and inhibition and working memory with lower effects (dppc2 = 0.17, dppc2 = 0.20).

AB  - In light of the increasing importance digital economy, the significance of computational thinking has grown exponentially, becoming imperative in both workplace and academic settings such as universities. This article addresses the critical need to comprehend the factors influencing the acceptance of computational thinking. The dataset introduces an extensive questionnaire comprising five constructs and 25 items, rooted in the extended Technology Acceptance Model. Notably, the model incorporates facilitating conditions and subjective norm, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding acceptance. Data collection involved 132 undergraduate university students sampled through purposive sampling, specifically targeting courses with a focus on computational thinking. The resulting dataset serves as a valuable resource for future research, offering detailed insights into the factors determining the acceptance of technology in educational contexts beyond mere thinking skills. Given the scarcity of research on technology acceptance in developing nations, this dataset holds particular significance, serving as a foundation for potential cross-cultural comparisons. The dataset contributes to the field by presenting a robust acceptance model, explaining 74.2 per cent of the variance in behavioural intention, 60.2 per cent in perceived usefulness, and 56.1 per cent in perceived ease of use. This high explanatory power positions the dataset as a superior resource for replication, benchmarking, and broader applicability in diverse contexts, thereby enhancing the understanding of computational thinking acceptance across different populations and settings. This dataset stands among the pioneering efforts to assess the novel covariance-based structural equation model algorithm within SmartPLS 4, presenting a valuable resource for future research employing the same mechanism.

AB  - This paper describes a study designed to investigate the promise of resources that support the development of computational thinking (CT) in preschool children. This study was the culmination of a collaborative research process between researchers and media developers of a home-based intervention that included media and hands-on activities created to support the development of young children's CT. The mixed-methods study included 108 families, each with a 4- or 5-year-old child. Families, who participated in the study at home for six weeks, were randomly assigned to an intervention group that viewed media and engaged with hands-on activities with a CT focus or a control group that viewed and engaged with non-STEM literacy content. Data collection consisted of parent surveys, parent interviews, and CT learning and pre-coding tasks to assess children's CT abilities. Results indicate that the learning intervention demonstrates promise in supporting parental understanding of CT. Experience with the intervention over the six weeks also appeared to cultivate some CT strategy use in children as evidenced by parental reports and performance on learning and pre-coding sequencing tasks.

AB  - This study characterizes the literature on teaching computational thinking (CT) to preschoolers aged 4 to 5 years. Previous research and published systematic studies have provided important contributions about CT teaching to elementary and high school children. However, to date, there is no systematic overview of CT education for preschoolers. For this reason, this systematic mapping synthesizes 82 studies on CT teaching, through the implementation and evaluation of tools and activities to teach, improve or measure the CT knowledge acquired by children. Furthermore, studies on courses or training offered to preschool teachers related to the teaching of CT were also considered. From the selected studies, the following information was collected: year of publication; recovery sources and databases; vehicles and places of publication; temporal delimitation of research, research approach, nature and research method; CT teaching approaches; tools used to teach CT and how they are classified according to their physical characteristics and, finally, participants and individuals responsible for the research. The results suggest an increase in the number of publications in recent years, revealing the interest of researchers in the topic. Furthermore, we observed a trend towards the use of physical artifacts and the use of the disconnected computing approach to teaching CT skills to preschool children. The results also exposed that preschool teachers have little autonomy in implementing CT teaching activities because those are mostly implemented by computer professionals (researchers, teachers, etc.). This is because preschool teachers are still discouraged from teaching computer and technology-related content to children, considering them complex and disconnected from basic curricula. However, when teachers are trained to teach CT, they become interested in the content and become more active during the teaching process. We argue for integrating CT-related content into education curricula and supporting preschool teachers to implement it autonomously in their classrooms.

AB  - This paper deals within a context where technology plays a pivotal role in education. In this sense, it is essential to highlight the emergence of new competencies and skills in education due to technological advancements. Legislative frameworks have been developed to incorporate digital literacy, access to robotics, and computational thinking, between others. Hence, this review and meta-analysis aim at identifying the influence of robotics activities on computational thinking through a PRISMA-guided review. The findings reveal that interventions conducted in early childhood education significantly impact computational thinking. Results also showcase that, despite perceived barriers related to technology accessibility, the presence of legislation and contexts prioritizing these competencies is more relevant than the digital access gap.

AB  - Since computational thinking is a high-level cognitive skill and its conceptual framework has not yet been clarified, the assessment of this skill is problematic. While there is no consensus in the literature about the components of computational thinking, the abstraction component is located at a point where opinions intersect. In addition, it is predicted that computer science unplugged activities will improve computational thinking, and there is limited research examining this effect. As a result, this research aims to demonstrate the alleged effects of computer science unplugged activities on abstraction skill which is considered the critical component of computational thinking. The study, which was planned with a mixed methods research design, lasted 8 weeks. Quantitative data were obtained from the abstraction skill test developed by the researchers, while qualitative data were obtained from observations and task- based interviews after each activity. Quantitative findings showed that computer science unplugged activities significantly improve abstraction skills and thus computational thinking. Qualitative findings not only revealed that developments in the six abstracting steps caused this significant difference but also identified abstracting steps where the effect of each activity was limited. Suggestions for organizing activities to improve these steps are given. Finally, suggestions are presented for the conceptual framework of computational thinking based on abstraction.

AB  - The healthy development of cognitive functions, including executive functions, has been shown to depend mainly on the experiences and learning opportunities of people, especially during childhood. Over the past few years, researchers have been studying the impacts of diverse types of interventions on children’s cognitive development in which computational thinking programs are a recent field. This pilot study evaluated the effect of computational thinking training based on the “Programming for Children” program on the executive functions of children aged 10 and 11 years: working memory, inhibition, and planning (N = 30). The results showed that children in the experimental group improved on tests of visuospatial working memory, cognitive inhibition, and sequential planning compared with the control group. However, tests of verbal working memory, memory strategy, and visual spatial planning did not show any observed changes. Although this was an exploratory study, and its findings should be interpreted cautiously due to the small sample size, the findings support the relevance and feasibility of conducting similar larger studies with larger samples.

AB  - Computational thinking has been promoted as an impactful 21st-century skillset that can be transferred to many other disciplines and problem scenarios. With the proliferation of age-appropriate coding platforms for young children, computational thinking has become increasingly popular in early childhood settings. However, there is a lack of research on introducing coding and computational thinking to teacher training in early childhood education. To empower early childhood teachers in the digital society, this study introduced 17 early childhood teachers to robot programming and computational thinking through the ‘CT4ECE’ professional development program, which includes three phases: Learn, Practice, and Reflect & Improve. Results of pre- and post-intervention surveys revealed that the CT4ECE program significantly enhanced teachers' robotics and pedagogical knowledge, as well as their attitudes towards computational thinking, especially their interest in and their view of using computational thinking in classroom practice. Post-intervention interviews indicated that participation in CT4ECE helped educators gain a basic understanding of both coding robots and computational thinking suitable for young children due to a structured change process for teachers' professional learning. This study establishes a strong foundation for enhancing and expanding the CT4ECE program, ultimately equipping teachers and children with the necessary skillsets to thrive in the digital future.

AB  - The purpose of the current study is to investigate the effects of the unplugged computational thinking (CT) integrated STEM (UCT-STEM) approach and STEM approach on early childhood pre-service teachers’ CT skills (creativity, algorithmic thinking, critical thinking, problem solving, cooperativity, communication). The study was conducted with a total of 70 early childhood pre-service teachers. Quasi-experimental design was used; activities based on the UCT-STEM approach were administered to the experimental group and activities based on the STEM approach were administered to the control group. Post-test scores for CT skills showed a statistically significant difference in favour of the experimental group. It was concluded that the UCT-STEM approach was more effective in developing the pre-service teachers’ CT skills than the STEM approach. The current study presents an important finding to the literature in terms of the developed STEM and UCT-STEM contents and how these contents improve pre-service teachers’ CT skills. The STEM and UCT-STEM content provides significant information in terms of teacher practices. At the same time, this study offers important implications for program developers and policy-makers to integrate these innovative educational approaches into both early childhood education and teacher education programs.

AB  - The integration of computational thinking (CT) to enhance creativity in design students has often been underexplored in design education. While design thinking has traditionally been the cornerstone of university design pedagogy and remains essential, the increasing role of digital tools and artificial intelligence in modern design practices presents new opportunities for innovation. By introducing CT alongside design thinking, students can expand their creative toolkit and engage with emerging technologies more effectively. Although many design students may have limited experience with programming, incorporating accessible, no-code tools can help them confidently embrace computational methods, unlocking new pathways for creative exploration and innovation. This study proposes an alternative approach to improve the motivation of design students by introducing machine learning tools into product design processes. We developed an experimental pedagogy in which 56 industrial design university students learned how to use Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (Weka), a machine learning tool, for three hours of design work a week, for a total of eight weeks. Our covariate analysis of data collected in the pretest and posttest shows that the general learning motivations in the group using Weka are significantly higher than those in the group without Weka. However, no significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of learning strategies, collaboration, or critical thinking. Students using Weka spent more time focusing on model training and tended to improve their algorithmic thinking, and the introduction of Weka appeared to enhance their motivation to learn. On the other hand, these students might have been focusing on working individually at their computers, potentially neglecting communication and collaboration. The findings suggest that teaching machine learning applications without requiring coding has the potential to boost design students' motivation to engage with CT skills, though care must be taken to maintain collaborative practices.

AB  - There is increasing effort to integrate Computational Thinking (CT) curricula across all education levels. Therefore, research on CT assessment has lately progressed towards developing and validating reliable CT assessment tools, which are crucial for evaluating students' potential learning progress and thus the effectiveness of suggested curricular programs. Several CT assessment tools were developed for elementary, high-school, and university students over the last years. Moreover, associations between CT scores and other cognitive abilities were unraveled. However, studies on the topic in primary school level are scarce. Like the general concept of intelligence, CT remains broadly defined as the ability to combine algorithmic operations to form complex solutions in order to solve problems effectively, utilizing concepts of computer science with or without the use of computers. In this study, we aimed at specifying a cognitive definition of CT, focusing on the under-investigated population of primary school children. Since validated assessment tools for this age group were not available, we adapted a validated CT test, which was initially designed for middle school students. In our study participated 192 third and fourth graders. The analyses revealed promising results on the reliability of the adapted CT assessment for primary school students. Moreover, findings indicated CT's positive associations with i. complex numerical abilities, ii. verbal reasoning abilities, and iii. non-verbal visuospatial abilities. Our results indicate similarities but also differences in associations of CT with other cognitive abilities in primary school children compared to other age groups. In summary: i. numerical abilities seem to associate with CT at the primary school level, whereas this seems not the case later on in education, ii. verbal abilities seem to associate with CT both along primary and secondary education levels, and iii. non-verbal reasoning abilities seem to associate with CT from primary education level to the university level and beyond. These differences imply that several basic cognitive abilities support CT abilities and CT development differentially across ages.

AB  - The concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI), born as the possibility of simulating the human brain's learning capabilities, quickly evolves into one of the educational technology concepts that provide tools for students to better themselves in a plethora of areas. Unlike the previous educational technology iterations, which are limited to instrumental use for providing platforms to build learning applications, AI has proposed a unique education laboratory by enabling students to explore an instrument that functions as a dynamic system of computational concepts. However, the extent of the implications of AI adaptation in modern education is yet to be explored. Motivated to fill the literature gap and to consider the emerging significance of AI in education, this paper aims to analyze the possible intertwined relationship between students’ intrinsic motivation for learning Artificial Intelligence during the COVID-19 pandemic; the relationship between students’ computational thinking and understanding of AI concepts; and the underlying dynamic relation, if existing, between AI and computational thinking building efforts. To investigate the mentioned relationships, the present empirical study employs mediation analysis based upon collected 137 survey data from Universidad Politécnica de Madrid students in the Institute for Educational Science and the School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering during the first quarter of 2022. Findings show that intrinsic motivation mediates the relationship between perceived Artificial Intelligence learning and computational thinking. Also, the research indicates that intrinsic motivation has a significant relationship with computational thinking and perceived Artificial Intelligence learning.

AB  - Computational thinking is widely recognized as an essential skill for adapting to the current era, with programming learning being the most effective means to develop it. It is recommended that computational thinking and learning programming be introduced as early as elementary school. However, elementary school students often possess limited prior knowledge of programming, posing challenges in their learning process. The graphic organizers (GOs) may serve as a bridge between students’ existing knowledge and new learning, facilitating a deeper processing of the overall information and thereby enhancing the learning process. This can be particularly advantageous for early-stage learners when grappling with difficult subjects. Consequently, this study employed GOs to assist elementary school students in their computational thinking and programming learning, employing a quasi-experiment design to evaluate their effectiveness. The results showed that although all students demonstrated awareness of applying computational thinking to solve problems, those exposed to GO-based instruction exhibited higher levels of computational thinking, programming skills, and flow experiences.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) practices is a critical cognitive tool for students to overcome challenges in this technological era. Few studies investigated CT practices from a development perspective. A two-year intervention was implemented in 30 intervention and 22 control schools in Hong Kong to promote CT education (T1baseline: N = 13,056; T2: N = 16,367; and T3: N = 15,269). Senior primary students (grades 4 to 6) around 8–12 years old were targeted. Among them, 34% were girls at T1baseline. Their learning progression of cognitive development was assessed with a CT practices test. Data were analyzed using item response analysis. Learning trajectories of CT practices were modeled to understand how students’ cognitive development differed between schools. Insights of findings were discussed in bringing CT practices to life.

AB  - Engagement is critical to computational thinking and programming education. However, as multi-dimensional variables, when analyzing how different aspects of engagement in computational thinking tasks influence skills development, it becomes crucial to discern precisely which engagement components intersect with the progression of computational thinking skills. This discernment is pivotal because engagement can vary based on the task nature, the context, and the individual's preferences. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the gender differences in engagement and computational thinking skills and the predictive relationships among these sub-dimensions for boys and girls in an unplugged environment. In this study, a quasi-experiment for 90 sixth-grade students from a north Chinese primary school was performed. By partial least squares–structural equation modeling, students’ models of computational thinking skills and engagement were analyzed, and comparisons of boys and girls were made by analysis of covariance statistics. Results indicated that compared with boys, girls reported higher computational thinking performance and more engagement in unplugged contexts. Furthermore, girls’ computational thinking skills were only predicted by their cognitive engagement, whereas boys’ computational thinking skills were predicted by their behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement. Teachers can adopt these findings to design computational thinking teaching interventions that combine the advantages of unplugged activity and focus on the engagement of boys and girls.

AB  - In this work, we argue for expanding the scope of K-12 computational thinking (CT) integration contexts to include everyday scenarios involving moral reasoning. Epistemic overlap between computational thinking practices and moral reasoning suggest that these contexts are potentially rich sites to see “seeds of CT” in children's reasoning and can provide rich educational pathways for children into CT. Taking a case-study approach, we examine the reasoning of a second-grader, Ollie, on a task involving fair allocation of resources to victims of a natural disaster. Our analysis finds that Ollie's reasoning was rich with seeds of CT (e.g., problem formulation, abstraction, complex-systems thinking) and that empathy served as an important supporting role to the CT. This work has implications for curricular design, suggesting that fairness and resource allocation scenarios with built-in opportunities for empathy might provide rich sandboxes for CT integration.

AB  - Although there are different definitions for computational thinking in the literature, it is possible to define it mainly as problem solving, designing and interpreting new systems by thinking like a computer. According to Wing (2006), computational thinking is a way of designing a system and understanding human behaviors by focusing on the basic concepts of the computer sciences. The recent focus on computational thinking as a key 21 st century skill for all students has led to a number of curriculum initiatives to embed it in K-12 classrooms and to introduce computing ideas to students early during their schooling years. The present study aims to explore the effects of a short, intensive coding and robotics training on the computational thinking skill self-efficacy of middle school students. 24 fifth graders participated in the study and data were collected by means of the Computational Thinking Self-efficacy scale (CTS) and one open-ended question. Analyses of the pre, post and delayed tests revealed significant differences between the pre and post-tests.

The benefits of utilizing the Design-Based Implementation Research (DBIR) approach in public libraries to resolve a persistent problem of practice, a lack of assessment tools to evaluate youth Computational Thinking (CT) programs, is demonstrated. Findings from a three-year, three-phased study utilizing the DBIR approach to design and implement a suite of assessment tools to assess CT programming in public libraries are presented. Guided by the four principles of the DBIR approach, this research produced new knowledge, including identifying CT program outcomes, challenges, and recommendations for designing and implementing assessment tools to measure the impact of public libraries' CT programming. Findings underscore the DBIR approach as a strategy for engaging with practitioners and helping shift their perspectives by resolving practice problems and facilitating the design of sustainable solutions.

AB  - Although there is controversy surrounding rewards and competition in education, they are key elements in digital game-based learning (DGBL). Research on the influence of rewards and competition in DGBL often yields mixed results, suggesting a need to investigate individual game elements and their interactions. This study implemented DGBL focusing on computational thinking (CT) in 7th-grade classes. Both quantitative and behavioral data were collected to understand the impact of rewards (power-up or customization) and competition (with or without) on students’ intrinsic motivation, game performance, behaviors, and CT skills. The findings uncovered significant interactions between rewards and competition. Students with both competition and power-up rewards achieved the highest game points but the lowest CT performance, whereas those exposed to the same power-up rewards without competition attained the lowest game points but the best CT performance. Implications are drawn for DGBL research and practice.

AB  - Despite growing interest in early childhood computational thinking (CT), there is a lack of validated assessments for children who are emerging readers. This paper presents validity and reliability evidence of a performance-based assessment of CT using item response theory (IRT) from 272 children aged 4–8. Using a two-parameter logistic model IRT model (2PL IRT), we confirmed that model- and item-level fits are acceptable. Item analyses revealed a high discriminability (M = 2.26, SD = 1.12) and a moderate item difficulty (M = −0.21; SD = 0.86), on average, across 19 items. Reliability analysis demonstrated that the assessment was substantially reliable (marginal reliability: rxx = 0.87). Differential item functioning (DIF) analyses indicated that the assessment estimated children's item parameters fairly, regardless of their gender and age. However, we confirmed gaps in latent ability (θ) of CT by gender and age: boys showed higher latent ability of CT than girls, and old children (above 72 months) showed higher latent ability than young children (below 72 months). Findings suggest the assessment is a fair measure that can serve as a reliable and valid tool to assess CT for children who are emerging readers.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is an important and essential skill for human beings to master in the 21st century. Although CT has received wide attention since this concept was proposed, the current theoretical models have not well defined the complex relations between CT and other cognitive abilities for young children. To provide insight into this gap, the current study proposed a model in which we hypothesized that CT was significantly related to arithmetic fluency that is viewed as an important domain of mathematics. Additionally, arithmetic fluency was predicted to mediate the relations of CT to other cognitive abilities, including reasoning and creativity. This study tested such direct and indirect relations in children aged 5–6 years. Consistent with previous studies on older age groups, the results showed that CT and arithmetic fluency were significantly related to each other and both were significantly related to reasoning ability and creative thinking as well. Moreover, this study, for the first time, indicated that arithmetic fluency totally mediated the relation between CT and reasoning ability, suggesting that these concepts share conceptual commonalities, such as the cognitive processes related to mathematics or/and abstraction; in contrast, arithmetic fluency did not mediate the relation between CT and creative thinking, suggesting that gaining CT skill may exert direct positive effect on the development of creativity. Therefore, despite the root in computer science, CT is associated with many cognitive and learning abilities in other domains, supporting the importance of including CT into early school education.

Learning games offer the potential for innovative, stealth assessments of students' implicit learning from gameplay behaviors. This paper reports on the measurement of implicit CT practices demonstrated by upper elementary- and middle-school students as they play the CT learning game Zoombinis. The process of using the gameplay log data to build valid automated detectors of students' implicit CT practices is discussed. Findings from this study provide implications for analyzing gameplay behaviors at scale, leading to the development of models for the assessment of implicit STEM learning.

We report on the design, evaluation, and outcomes of the Computational Thinking Unplugged for Science (CT-UP-S) professional development program for inservice science teachers. Our process-based approach to CT significantly improved teachers CT understanding and CT/science integration self-efficacy by systematically linking CT practices to scaffold the generation of unplugged algorithms. Additionally, we found that the process-based approach provided a framework for teachers' lesson planning and that teachers’ content knowledge moderated their ability to write CT-integrated science lessons.

AB  - Early evidence suggests that robot programming offers an important foundation for spatial reasoning and computational thinking; however, researchers have debated how to introduce young children to these skills. We explored how preschoolers develop understanding of spatial concepts and computational thinking as the children took turns navigating a path during guided play with a programmable robot. Our analysis of the data included a multimodal visualization of the exchanges between the teacher, children, and a programmable robotic device. The findings highlight the effects that arose from the physical-digital convergence of technology integrated into play including: (a) the robot evoked a chain of actions, enacting pedagogic forces that transformed children's learning; (b) children used their own bodies as spatial referents, co-locating themselves in space with the robot; (c) the teacher remained a key actor, providing verbal and nonverbal scaffolding to promote children's understanding and mastery of spatial and computational concepts; and (d) talking with the teacher about spatial concepts combined with the interactions with the robot enhanced children's acquisition of spatial ideas relative to the quantity of children's verbal expressions and complexity of their applied spatial skills and computational thinking.

AB  - Workers in the areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics play a significant role in the sustained growth and stability of the global economy, and, thus constitute a critical component in helping all countries worldwide to prosper. In this context, computational thinking constitutes an important skill to have as it enables workers to develop creative solutions to complex problems. Nonetheless, across all economies worldwide, there is a need to have more workers who are able to think through problems, challenges, and solutions in computational terms. It is thus of utmost importance to integrate the teaching of computational thinking in K-12 education in order to reduce the skills gap between education and the workplace. A pertinent and crucial question that arises is whether teachers have the knowledge and skills to teach students how to think computationally. Existing research shows that teacher education departments do not currently have the knowledge to promote computational thinking in their programs. The present study focuses on two aspects of computational thinking, such as, algorithmic thinking and debugging skills with the use of scaffolded programming scripts in an educational technology undergraduate course. The results show statistically significant learning gains in pre-service teachers’ algorithmic thinking and debugging skills in the context of robotic programming activities with LEGO WeDo. Limitations and future research directions are discussed.

AB  - Recent studies identify Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) as a key factor in enhancing cognitive development, particularly within Computational Thinking (CT) literature. However, research gaps remain in understanding how SRL and CT interact from a developmental perspective. Our study designed a program with tailored animations and worksheets to specifically foster students' learning and cognitive development. Using a mixed-methods approach, we administered surveys among 1235 students from 29 Hong Kong primary schools to investigate a dynamic learning system comprising SRL and CT in a large-scale CT program. Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 students to further probe insights. Quantitative findings revealed a mutually reinforcing relationship in the dynamic system, suggesting that higher SRL skills enhance cognitive CT abilities, and vice versa. Complementing these results, qualitative findings showed that integrating animations and worksheets into the CT program significantly boosted students' SRL and cognitive development. These findings have significant implications for educational practices and curriculum design. Schools should consider implementing SRL strategies, such as proactive goal setting and reflective evaluation, within their curricula to promote students’ cognitive development. Furthermore, strategic investments in educational technology, including collaborations with EdTech developers, are essential to create effective, pedagogically sound tools that enhance learning outcomes. These insights provide valuable guidance for creating a supportive SRL environment that fosters cognitive development in primary school education.

AB  - In recent years, there has been increasing interest in integrating Computational Thinking (CT) into elementary schools. However, few studies have focused on teachers’ perceptions. This study aims to examine teachers' perceptions to bridge the gap between theory and practice. The study analysed teachers’ perceptions of integrating CT into school subjects through the constructionist approach, using Scratch a leading programming platform inspired by Resnick's Lifelong Kindergarten Constructionist model. Over a school year, 31 teachers participated in a professional development program and applied this model in their classrooms. The teachers were interviewed to capture their perceptions of learning and teaching using a constructionist method. The findings revealed that teachers with creative arts experience fully embraced the model, while others partially adopted it. Teachers recognized the benefits of constructionist teaching in fostering creativity, motivation, and engagement among students. However, they struggled with balancing these benefits with school demands and constraints. Challenges included managing time effectively within constraints of school and ensuring curriculum alignment. Despite this, many teachers found that the constructionist approach positively impacted students' learning engagement and personal development. By addressing the identified challenges, teacher education designers, curriculum developers, and schools can develop practices for closing the gap between theory and practice.

AB  - Educational research on predicting learners’ computer programming performance has yielded practical implications that guide task designs in computer education. There have been attempts to investigate learners’ computer programming patterns using high-frequency and automated data collection. This approach can be considered as process-based analysis as opposed to outcome-based analysis (i.e., the use of test or exam scores). In this process-based approach to investigate learners’ computer programming process, we included two critical constructs in our research, self-regulated learning and computational thinking skills. We aimed to identify learners’ computer programming patterns in the context that novice students learn a computer programming language, Python, in an online coding environment. We examined the relationships between the learners’ coding patterns, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills. Initially, we adopted a traditional approach with the aggregate data of learners’ computer programming behaviors. We then utilized a computational analytics approach to learner performance, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills, with ever-changing computer programming patterns. In our initial approach, the indicators of aggregate computer programming data were not associated with learners' learning performance and computational thinking skills. In the computational analysis approach, many indicators revealed significant differences between the identified patterns regarding computational thinking skills and self-regulated learning. Recommendations about the use of programming log data analysis methods and future scaffolding for computer programming learners are addressed.

AB  - In the field of education, research has consistently emphasized mathematical creative thinking as a crucial component of 21st-century skills. Thus, this cross-sectional study examines the predictors of such thinking by specifically focusing on the roles of perceived creativity, creative self-efficacy, and computational thinking. The participants consisted of 896 secondary school students (52.9 % female; 47.1 % male) in Indonesia who were asked to complete a series of online questionnaires and tests. For analysis, structural equation modeling was employed, demonstrating satisfactory construct validity and instrument reliability. Based on the results, there was a positive association between computational thinking and mathematical creative thinking. In addition, perceived creativity had a positive impact on mathematical creative thinking, whereas creative self-efficacy showed a negative association. As for the empirical model, it revealed that computational thinking plays a mediating role, connecting perceived creativity and creative self-efficacy to mathematical creative thinking. The findings suggest that incorporating these skills and related variables into the mathematics curriculums in schools is essential for preparing students for success in the 21st century.

AB  - Previous studies have explored the relationship between computational thinking (CT) and creativity. However, a consensus has yet to be reached since both CT and creativity varied in ideation and assessment. To uncover the cognitive mechanism underlying the interplay between CT and creativity, we conduct a scoping review of 26 empirical studies published in 2006–2024. Our findings suggested that the effects of working memory varied in the interplay between CT and creativity due to differences in age range, neural network activation regions, and measurements. Intellectual abilities, including algorithmic fluency, reasoning ability, and coding ability, showed cognitive transfer effect on CT skills but not necessarily on creativity, suggesting that cognitive abilities embracing more intelligent elements may contribute to the functional connectivity in CT neural networks but only partly overlapped with creativity involved networks. Although executive functions (working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control) play a crucial role in both CT and creativity, their contributions to the CT-creativity interplay are still rarely studied. Future research should explore the CT-creativity relationship from the perspective of neuroscience.

AB  - This systematic review examined how computer science (CS) education was implemented in schools and its efficacy for developing students’ computational thinking (CT). Sixty-six papers were selected for this systematic review and analyzed for patterns in relation to the implementation of CS education in K-12 schools and its impact on the development of students’ CT skills. Although educational interventions have not always been successful in CS education, this review provides strong evidence that overall, CS education promotes the development of students’ CT in the K-12 setting while improving their creative and critical thinking skills. We recommend early access to CS education, various innovative instructional approaches to CS education and appropriate support and guidance for student learning.

AB  - Recently, the development of computational thinking (CT) skills has become widespread in the whole world. There is a consensus to develop students’ CT skills through unplugged and plugged-in programming. However, the choice of programming approaches taught in schools is arbitrary and few studies have compared the effectiveness differences between unplugged and plugged-in programming. This study aimed to explore the differences between unplugged and plugged-in programming in developing CT skills of students in Grades 1-2 students. It also explored the joint effects of students’ gender, programming experience, programming interest, and programming confidence with different programming approaches on CT skills. The quasi-experimental research approach was used to conduct 10 weeks of unplugged, plugged-in, and regular programming activities with 124 Grades 1-2 students. The results found that unplugged programming promoted CT skills more in the early primary grades than plugged-in programming. We found that boys and students with programming experience in unplugged group performed significantly better in CT skills than in plugged-in group. Moreover, the improvement of CT skills of students in unplugged group was positively correlated with the level of their programming interest and programming confidence. However, these were not observed in plugged-in group. The results of this study can provide precise guidance for teaching CT skills to early primary school students and provide references for CT education.

AB  - This paper presents an investigation that compares and analyzes the interactions of three groups of pre-and-primary school children with three different storytelling systems. We identify emerging patterns through which they engaged in what we refer to as narrative computational thinking. The latter describes broadened aspects of narrative literacy practices that are linked to computational thinking. By applying a multicase study approach and through various vignettes, we illustrate how children applied computational thinking to understand and influence the narrative possibilities offered by the different tools. Our results illustrate circumstances under which digital storytelling activities provide a favorable basis for narrative computational thinking, and that when computational thinking functions as a scaffold for story creation, it encourages a blend of creativity and computational thinking, providing a compelling approach to introducing emerging digital literacies to young children in a narrative context.

AB  - In this study, it is aimed to identify the computational thinking skills used by gifted and talented students in integrated STEM activities based on the EDP. The case study design, a qualitative research method, is employed in the study. The participants consist of gifted and talented students attending the Science and Arts Center. Integrated STEM activities based on the EDP were conducted over the course of ten weeks and among these activities, robotic and 3D modeling-based robot construction activities using Lego sets are addressed in the present study. The STEM activity booklet, researchers' fieldnotes, and teaching process video recordings were used as data collection tools in the study. Data that was collected was analyzed through content analysis. It was seen that gifted and talented students participating in integrated STEM activities based on the EDP make active use of critical thinking skills while providing explanations, making associations, questioning information, giving justifications, solving problems, thinking creatively, making generalizations, and attempting to convince others; as for the instances of defining problems, creating solutions, and evaluating the effectiveness of the solution, the students were observed to actively use their problem-solving skills. The detailed account provided by the study on the way robotic and 3D robot modeling activities improve the computational thinking skills of gifted and talented students contributes to the required educational support and to the existing body of literature.

AB  - In the artificial intelligence age, cultivating young children's computational thinking (CT) has sparked tremendous attention. Programmable robotics is a developmental-appropriate and screen-free means that provides young children with great opportunities to learn programming and develop CT. However, it is reported that young children might have difficulties learning abstract CT concepts. As a helpful pedagogical facilitator, metaphors can help turn abstract concepts into more concrete and clear concepts that learners are familiar with. Therefore, this research proposed a metaphor-based robot programming (MRP) approach and explored its impact on young children's CT and behavioral patterns. A total of 118 children aged 5–6 were recruited in this experiment with two conditions: the experimental group adopted the metaphor-based robot programming (MRP) approach while the control group used the conventional robot programming (CRP) approach. Results revealed that children who adopted the MRP approach outperformed children who adopted the CRP approach on CT. In addition, behavioral analysis indicated that the proposed MRP approach could facilitate children's superior learning performance and more positive learning behaviors, so as to help them achieve learning objectives. Accordingly, this study can provide insightful guidance and inspiration for future research on effective programming teaching and CT development for young children.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is a necessary skill for students. It is as important as the other essential skills such as reading, writing, and arithmetic. However, how to improve students’ CT in robotics is still to be explored. Hence, this study examined the effects of computer supported project-based learning (CSPBL) on students’ CT and learning engagement through comparing students’ CT and engagement in two courses instructed by the same instructor (one instructed with a traditional method, the other instructed with CSPBL). Participants were seventy-nine students from a university in China. Questionnaires, interviews, and project analysis were used to measure students’ CT and learning engagement. The comparative results of self-reports and final projects indicated that the CSPBL enhanced students’ CT. The simulation project training based on the SenseStudy learning platform in CSPBL helped students debug the programming code, optimize the algorithm design, and improve their algorithmic thinking, cooperation, and problem solving during the program error correction. The CSPBL also improved students’ engagement in learning, especially for those with more than one year of programming experience. It was found that the CSPBL was effective in terms of improving students’ CT and engagement in robotics learning. This study provides teachers with practical suggestions to conduct effective robotics instruction.

AB  - Malaysia has introduced computational thinking skills as part of a curriculum integration update to meet the global trends in 21st-century education, focusing on empowering digital literacy. Nevertheless, a preliminary investigation revealed an apparent lack of understanding of computational thinking skills in general among teachers. The study explores the feasibility of developing a localized E-learning system to train computational thinking skills among teachers. An E-learning system, termed as myCTGWBL, was developed on the basis of a newly proposed conceptual framework to present computational thinking teaching–learning repertoire to the teachers. The hypothesis is that myCTGWBL would develop teachers' computational thinking and its position in teaching–learning understanding. myCTGWBL relevance was tested through DeLone and McLean's information system and Urbach's collaboration quality construct. To determine the success factors, partial least squares structural equation modeling was used. A total of 369 teachers participated in a two-stage survey. Participants' understanding of computational thinking and perceptions were recorded at the pre- and post-intervention phases. Open-ended questions of the surveys were analyzed using a simple text analysis technique. The closed-ended questions surveys were analyzed using SPSS Statistics 22.0. A significant improvement in teachers' computational thinking teaching–learning repertoire in a relatively short period has been recorded. Teachers also demonstrated increased confidence in the future delivering computational thinking-based lessons. The E-learning conceptual framework has illustrated the predictive power between user intent, user satisfaction, and Computational thinking (CT) knowledge benefits. Results demonstrate that myCTGWBL could be used to guide future planning when establishing CT knowledge acquisition initiatives, particularly among teachers.

AB  - Efforts to incorporate computational thinking (CT) into academic courses have been gaining popularity. CT is a problem-solving skill that is crucial in the 21st century. CT may be used to support language education. Courses in English as a foreign language often need an effective writing component that includes writing organization and language use, as demonstrated by the poor writing samples often generated by students of these courses. To address the problems, CT, which is a higher-order mode of problem-solving and knowledge acquisition optimization, was used. The experimental group was instructed using the CT teaching model based on CT's essential components (decomposition, generalization, abstraction, algorithm, and evaluation), whereas the control group was taught using the conventional method. In total, 58 undergraduate students divided into two groups participated in this study. A combination of writing, CT skills, surveys, and interviews were used to collect data according to an experimental design. The collected quantitative data were analyzed through analysis of covariance and structural equation modeling, and the MAXQDA 2022software was used to analyze the collected qualitative data. The results of this study indicate that incorporating CT into an English writing course enhances the writing and higher-order thinking skills of students. The CT concepts helps students develop critical thinking skills by evaluating the text and identifying potential issues or improvements. Additionally, it allows students to use their skills to create unique writing solutions, which can boost English writing creativity.

AB  - Computational thinking education has become an increasingly popular topic among practitioners and researchers. However, rare is known how to effectively teach and learn computational thinking in early childhood education. To address this knowledge gap, this systematic review examined 26 studies on the teaching and learning of computational thinking in early childhood education from 2010 to 2022. The content knowledge, tools, pedagogical design, assessment methods, and learning outcomes were analyzed. Results indicated that, with age-appropriate instructional design, children could develop early concepts and skills of computational thinking, as well as other related skills such as communication, collaboration, and problem solving. Across the studies, we found that most studies used quantitative research methods, with direct assessment and observation being the most. Several challenges were identified: (1) achieving a deeper learning of computational thinking; (2) a lack of valid and reliable computational thinking assessments for children with a wider age range; (3) selecting appropriate learning tools; and (4) designing age-appropriate activities for young learners. Although with these challenges, computational thinking education could bring new learning opportunities and enhance children's computational thinking skills, as well as other non-cognitive skills such as critical thinking, body-material interaction, and hand-eye coordination. This systematic review informs future endeavors in theorizing a digital learning framework that can integrate computational thinking into early childhood education.

AB  - Teacher competencies encompass the dimensions of knowledge and attitudes, yet few studies have analysed teachers' latent profiles in relation to the interaction between these two dimensions. Latent profile analysis, which examines the interplay between variables to distinguish subgroups of individuals, has recently emerged in studies of computational thinking (CT) as a method for identifying student profiles. However, the latent profiles of CT teachers have not yet been analysed. We therefore analysed the latent profiles of a sample of 493 teachers who had participated in a teacher development programme in CT, according to their knowledge and perceived usefulness of CT. Three profiles were identified: (1) highly knowledgeable with high perceived usefulness, (2) knowledgeable with low perceived usefulness, and (3) less knowledgeable with low perceived usefulness. Qualitative data further triangulated these findings. We also examined the learning achievement of 12,105 students taught by these teachers. Students taught by highly knowledgeable teachers with a high perceived sense of usefulness demonstrated significantly better achievement than their peers. Our findings highlight the importance of nurturing both knowledge of and perceived usefulness in CT. They also provide valuable insights for similar teacher development programmes, emphasizing the importance of peer mentoring support for less knowledgeable teachers. Additionally, we underscore the value of having teachers create artefacts using CT for instructional purposes, allowing them to gain firsthand experience of its usefulness. As few studies have explored teachers' latent profiles based on the dimensions of knowledge and attitudes, the contribution of this study extends beyond the domain of CT.

AB  - We designed a controlled trial protocol that seeks to contribute to cognitive science by studying the effect of thought training on children's executive functions. The study design is a cluster randomized controlled trial, with intra-subject and inter-subject evaluation, with two parallel groups: an experimental group and a TAU control group. With three measures, pre-test, post-test, and follow-up after three months. The participants will be children aged 9 to 11. The allocation will be randomized by groups and not individually. The sample will be a minimum of 44 participants. The primary measures will be neuropsychological tests to assess executive functions. Secondary measures will be a computational thinking test, neuropsychological tests to assess metacognition and attention, and an acceptability scale. The experimental group will participate in the COGNI-MACHINE computational thinking training designed by the first author. The training frequency will be twice a week in 60 min sessions for 12 weeks. The TAU control group will receive computer science classes as usual during the same time as the experimental group. The evaluators taking the measurements will be blinded to the assignment. The investigators in charge of the intervention will be blinded to the results of the evaluations.

AB  - Negative feedback can temporarily relieve negative Chinese transfer (NCT) in English as a foreign language (EFL) syntactic writing by focusing only on the surface writing constructs, neglecting that EFL writing is an embodiment of the process by which higher-order thinking operates. To solve the problem, the researchers conducted a pretest, interventionist group dynamic assessment (IGDA) in the form of negative feedback based on computational thinking (CT), higher-order thinking, and post-test quasi-experimental design, with a control group receiving the direct correction feedback instructing model to mitigate the NCT in EFL syntactic writing. We analyzed the syntactic writing types and frequencies of the NCT obtained through repeated-measure ANOVA and confirmed by qualitative data through video recording. The results indicated that IGDA in the form of negative feedback based on CT principal skills could (1) significantly decrease syntactic writing errors caused by the NCT, (2) improve learners’ EFL writing performance, and finally, (3) elevate the computer as an essential mediation tool. This innovative instructing mode of intervening with writing constructs and higher-order thinking and bringing about deeper thinking and creativity contributes to the EFL writing teaching methodology in a foreign language higher education.

AB  - The tenure system in the United States places significant importance on teaching effectiveness. To date, students' evaluations of teaching (SETs) have been the reigning mechanism for assessing effective teaching. However, prior work has shown that SETs are often biased against underrepresented groups and minorities. The present study analyzes options for effective teaching assessments, which include evaluating final grades and measuring the differences between students’ pre- and post-tests (normalized gain) using standard instruments. The content area and the instrument used in this study originated in the computational thinking field, which has a widespread presence in engineering, where minorities are at a disadvantage. This study obtained a total of 88 student participants from four sections of an introductory engineering course at a Southwestern institution. The study utilized a computational thinking diagnostic (CTD) to inform the course teaching approach (the intervention). Results show that (a) normalized learning gains correlated moderately with SETs, (b) final grades correlated strongly with SETs, (c) final grades correlated strongly with normalized learning gains, (d) the educational intervention based on the CTD significantly affected student learning, and (e) SET comments affect evaluations. The implications include the notion that standardized instrument-driven instruction and evaluations can increase the success of minorities on both sides of the classroom. The purpose of this manuscript is to invite the Heliyon readership to get involved in the development of related instruments and to incorporate these measures of learning into their instruction so biases are avoided or minimized.

AB  - In the digital age, our lives become more dependent on technology, yet the digital gap is intensifying especially because most people lack digital literacy. As a modest step to handle this challenge, we designed a course named "Play with me in Code" to develop pre-service teachers' (PSTs) thinking skills and expose them to learning by creation using computational thinking and programming as part of the constructionism paradigm. The added value of using Scratch in the context of teacher education lies not only in familiarity with a programming language but with an emphasis on experiencing self-directed learning tackling with problem solving situations, creativity, socioemotional competencies, and logical computational thinking. The present study aims to examine 25 PSTs' attitudes towards facing challenges of coding with Scratch. To this end, a mixed-method approach was activated by using questionnaires, blog posts, and reflections. Findings revealed that the learning environment encouraged PSTs' use of abstraction and decomposition to address a complex problem or to design a complex game. Study's conclusions relate to the importance of providing PSTs opportunities to experience learning by programming for raising their awareness of the importance of enhancing thinking skills and creativity in the future.

AB  - Using the analytical tool CiteSpace, this review study conducted a bibliometric analysis of the characteristics of 249 studies on Computational Thinking (CT) indexed in the Web of Science from 2012 to 2021. The multi-dimensional analytical approach provided a holistic view of the scope of CT research and its progression,and enabled the major topics, themes, disciplinary domains, and prominent authors, institutes, countries/regions, and papers to be identified. Based on the general descriptive data analysis, the results showed that CT has gained increasing influence as a field of research over the past decade. A clustering analysis of the retrieved keywords showed that the development of CT in K-12 education was the most frequently discussed topic. The co-occurrence knowledge maps identified the 11 main research themes and their progress. The research was from a wide spectrum of disciplines including education, science education, computer science, interdisciplinary application, psychology, engineering, and information systems. The highest co-citations were found in the journals of Communication of the ACM, Computers and Education, and Computers in Human Behaviors. The researchers, institutes, and countries/regions that have made the most significant contributions to CT research and the 10 most highly cited CT studies were also identified. Overall, the findings of this review study indicate the paths for future research on developing CT in the classroom.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT), a way to think about solving problems, is recognized as a basic skill for the 21st century. Although game-based learning (GBL) has been shown to improve student's CT skills, students may fail to self-evaluate or debate as they play games, thus failing to develop higher-order thinking. Also not widely explored is how teachers are to practice the CT core competencies during the learning process to cultivate students' problem-solving thinking. As the adoption of student-generated questions (SGQ) is an instructional strategy to promote higher-order thinking, we develop a GBL platform that uses this strategy to enhance students' CT skills, learning motivation, and learning confidence. For this purpose, fifty-three primary school students were recruited for this study, and data were collected during four classes of experimental CT activities. This study shows that the experimental group using the SGQ strategy with a GBL platform exhibited significantly higher CT skills than the control group. In addition, with respect to learning motivation and learning confidence it is found that the experimental group also outperformed the control group. This confirms that integrating the SGQ strategy and CT core competencies fosters higher-order cognitive thinking in students in problem-solving through gamification of the learning environment, resulting in higher motivation and confidence to complete experimental activities.

AB  - To effectively utilize artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies such as ChatGPT and realize their novel ethical issues, individuals must have a variety of knowledge and skills about AI. Such knowledge and skills have led to the emergence of AI literacy. Despite the importance of AI literacy in everyday life, little is known about its determinants. To better understand the determinants of AI literacy, we attempted to build a research model relying on previous research and different theoretical frameworks. The model incorporated digital divide, cognitive absorption, and computational thinking. As a major finding from the current study, computational thinking was found to be a significant determinant of AI literacy, which facilitate using, recognizing, and evaluating AI-based technologies. Moreover, we found out that individuals with physical access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) are more expected to use and recognize AI. Also, motivation and skills in using ICTs enable individuals to better evaluate the outcomes of AI-based technologies. The findings also showed that convenient access to ICTs contributes to a deep involvement with AI-based technologies in the use. Further, individuals with higher motivation and skills to use AI technologies are likely to have a pleasant experience after using these technologies.

AB  - Both computational thinking (CT) and creativity have been recognized as key skills for today's learners. Over the last decade, research of both skills in a single context has emerged. In this paper, we present a scoping review of 62 such empirical from 2011 to 2020. Our goal was to have a thorough understanding of the educational settings in which research on both CT and creativity was conducted, the theoretical foundations it has laid down, and the research tools used. Our findings indicate a geographical bias (dominance of the US and prominence of developed European countries), as well as a focus on secondary education and on STEM-related disciplines; this could be explained by the current situation of CT spread. We also found that when studying CT and creativity jointly, it is most common to define CT in a broader perspective than merely programming of computer science. Additionally, while creativity is largely referred to as product-related, CT is barely referred to as such. Taken together, our findings point out some gaps in the current research of CT and creativity and suggest how it should be expended on the fertile grounds of creativity, as the latter crosses geographical, age, and subject borders. Doing so may build a bridge between CT and creativity in a way that will benefit both.

AB  - This paper sheds light on 3–5-year-old children’s enactments of computational empowerment (CE) in activities with computational thinking (CT). CT is widely elaborated on as a universal problem-solving approach and a skill set necessary for thriving in today’s digitized societies. Scholars claim that CT for all should be ensured from an early age, and several studies develop and examine age-appropriate technological tools, as well as pedagogical approaches, for young children’s learning of CT. Based on 1.5 years of co-designing for children’s situated CT in two Danish kindergartens, the present study conducts a socioculturally informed analysis of video-observed interactions between children and educational robots. The findings display how children and robots engage in interactions that transcend children’s mastery of CT in any narrow sense. This is examined as situated enactments of CE; as children’s critical and informed decisions regarding the roles that technologies, in this case educational robots, can play in their institutionally situated social lives. The paper concludes that children’s various enactments of CE deserve scholarly and professional attention, both as an important prerequisite for, and as a necessary limitation to, the implementation of CT in kindergartens.

AB  - Since the end of the 20th century, the digitalization of society, including the educational systems, has been growing exponentially. At the same time, education systems have been evolving towards competency-based assessment. Likewise, at the beginning of this century, the idea of Computational Thinking was resurrected by J. Wing, for solving problems and designing systems using concepts of computer science. Today, we can see how all these questions are taking shape in a new competence, called Computational Thinking, related to others that already exist. In this paper, we have studied the skills of Computational Thinking in university students, focusing on abstraction and its possible relationship with other factors. Results conclude that the students fail in relation to abstraction and in algorithmic thinking. Although the ability of abstraction is not easy to measure, a linear regression analysis has been carried out in order to determine its possible study.

AB  - Teaching computational thinking (CT) has become a priority for educators and policymakers tasked with educating and training students for future jobs which are predicted to be increasingly automated. Recent research on effective instructional interventions for developing computational thinking skills, including algorithmic and critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity, and cooperativity, suggests that teaching and learning CT can improve student academic performance. In fact, the extant literature is quite sanguine about the topic of CT. However, few studies have attempted to establish a relationship between CT skills and academic performance. In the present cross-sectional study, we employ path analysis to model the structural relationship between self-reported CT skills and academic performance of a sample of 81 computer science undergraduates enrolled at a Southwestern American university. We found few direct relationships between CT skills and academic performance. We only find a significant positive relationship between creativity and academic performance and a significant negative relationship between cooperativity and academic performance. Our findings are surprising considering the abundant research promoting computational thinking as a key component of 21st century skills. The findings call for further in-depth analysis of computational thinking and the influence on students’ learning and learning outcomes. We discuss our results with respect to recent educational mandates for including CT and instructional alignment in school curricula. Our findings contribute to the existing discussion by helping to clarify the relationship between CT skills and academic performance in higher education.

AB  - Although studies have shown that computational thinking (CT) can enhance learning processes and outcomes across traditional subjects, they have not shown how teachers might scaffold children's CT processes in a technology-mediated learning context. This exploratory study examined how teacher talk and technologies impacted the CT of three children (6 to 8 years old). Seven videotaped 90-minute sessions of weekly project-based activities yielded 4,842 turns of talk (2,974 by children). Statistical discourse analysis revealed the following results. After a teacher command, the children more often executed a sequence of actions toward a solution but less often demonstrated problem understanding than otherwise. Following a teacher's open question, the children were more likely to offer logically organized ideas. In response to a teacher's rhetorical question, they more often searched for information. These results inform educators regarding when to use each type of teacher talk to scaffold children's CT processes.

AB  - ChatGPT (generative pre-trained transformer) is one of the artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that have started to be used in programming education. However, the effect of using ChatGPT in programming education on learning processes and outcomes is not yet known. This study investigated the effect of programming education using the ChatGPT on students' computational thinking skills, programming self-efficacy, and motivation toward the lesson. The research was conducted on 45 undergraduate students who took a university-level programming course. The research was carried out according to the experimental design with the pretest-posttest control group. Students were randomly divided into experimental (n = 21) and control (n = 24) groups. While the experimental group students benefited from the ChatGPT during the weekly programming practices, the control group students did not use this tool. Research data were obtained through the computational thinking scale, computer programming self-efficacy scale, and learning motivation in computer programming courses scale. Research findings revealed that the experimental group students' computational thinking skills, programming self-efficacy, and motivation for the lesson were significantly higher than the control group students. In line with this result, it can be said that it may be useful to benefit from AI technologies such as ChatGPT in programming trainings. The research findings, it was emphasized how the most effective use of AI support in the lessons could be made, and various suggestions were made for researchers and educators in this regard.

AB  - In this paper, we explore how the theoretical notion of possibility space offers a way to study how children's computational thinking develops as a process. Drawing on embodied notions of cognition, we first examine the literature that supports how children's computational thinking emerges as a possibility space that involves conceptualizing possible actions in a given moment, deciding which action to take by anticipating the results of a possible action, and learning from the actions that they have taken. We then use a grounded approach to analyze the problem-solving process of two 5th-grade children who engaged in an educational robotics activity over two 50-minute class periods. The findings lend support for approaching children's computational thinking as a cycle of action-taking that includes conceptualizing, anticipating, and taking action. The findings also support the pedagogical practice of having children predict the results of a computer program to enhance their computational thinking. Implications for the way that teachers can support children in learning to conceptualize what is possible and take action from it are discussed.

AB  - Predictive learner modelling is crucial for personalized education. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great success in education, their potential in learner modelling via image data is unexplored. This research introduces a novel and interpretable approach for Image-based Learner Modelling (ImageLM) using CNNs and transfer learning to model learners’ performance and accordingly classify their computational thinking solutions. The approach integrates Grad-CAM, enabling it to provide insights into its decision-making process. Findings show that our custom CNN outperforms other models (namely ResNet, VGG, and Inception), with 83% accuracy in predicting solution correctness. More importantly, the ImageLM approach identifies the regions that contribute the most to the predictions, shedding light on learners' computational thinking knowledge and advancing toward trustworthy AI for education. These results underline the potential of utilizing imagery data from learners’ activities during the learning process to predict their performance, especially in challenging environments like programming where traditional feature extraction and learning might struggle.

AB  - The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has led to the proliferation of computational thinking (CT) education. However, research on unplugged activities’ influence in elementary math classrooms is limited, despite some exploring programming's cognitive benefits. This study presents both qualitative and quantitative analyzes stemming from a ten-week quasi-experimental research endeavor, specifically tailored for third-grade students. The research devised a series of unplugged activities, encompassing mathematical games, hands-on construction of mathematical logic boards, and calculating shopping discounts. The overarching objective was to investigate the impact of these unplugged activities on students’ mathematical creativity and CT. Students participating in a mathematics curriculum based on unplugged activities (N = 47) were compared with students participating in a traditional lecture-based mathematics curriculum (N = 46). The results indicated that unplugged activities exhibited significant advantages in fostering students’ CT and mathematical creativity across three dimensions, namely, problem-posing creativity (t = 5.830, p < 0.01), problem-solving creativity (t = 6.633, p < 0.01), and creative self-efficacy (t = 7.554, p < 0.01). Furthermore, the study revealed a relationship between students’ mathematical creativity as a predictor of CT. The results of the quantitative analysis were supported by the teacher's and students’ interview data, and the students felt excited and interested in the unplugged activities, whereas some students using the lecture-based method reported boredom and lack of interactivity. This research offered valuable insights for mathematics and CT education practice, underscoring unplugged activity as an innovative instructional approach that brings forth new possibilities for traditional mathematics teaching, with potential applications in the K-12 curriculum.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has received worldwide attention due to its alignment with developing 21st century skills such as creativity, problem-solving, and digital competence. With the increasing provision of programming tools such as robotic toys and tablet apps in the sector of early childhood education (ECE), many ECE researchers and practitioners tend to link CT to programming. However, children are reluctant to sustain their interests in programming activities, and may be further demotivated by debugging failures. This multi-group quasi-experimental study aimed to evaluate the effects of a story-inspired approach in bridging the gap between programming and CT for preschool children. Building on previous literature suggesting storytelling as a powerful, culturally responsive pedagogy, 5-year-old children (N=108) were involved in nine weeks of CT learning via one of the three conditions: Story-Inspired Robot Programming (SIRP), Story-Inspired Tablet Programming (SITP), and unplugged CT education. Results revealed that children who participated in the SIRP and SITP conditions showed improved CT scores, relative to unplugged CT education, even after controlling for baseline CT scores. No gender or family socioeconomic effects were found to influence the benefits of story-inspired programming interventions. These findings suggest that storytelling as a culturally responsive approach, whether using robots or tablets as a programming tool, can provide young children with more inclusive and sustainable CT learning experiences.

AB  - Content area K-12 teachers are increasingly asked to integrate computing and computational thinking into their classrooms, yet they often have little experience with computing. The purpose of this study was to understand how science teachers, new to computing and integrating computational thinking into their classrooms, supported students as computational problem solvers. In the project from which this research was drawn, 8th grade science teachers in three US school districts integrated computer game design into their study of climate systems and climate change. We conducted participant observation, collected teacher implementation logs and interviewed 15 teachers engaged in the three-year design research project, Building Systems from Scratch. Analysis through grounded theory yielded several results related to teachers’ orientations, strategies, and use of resources to create systems of distributed expertise. We identified five major themes: a) releasing responsibility to students, b) co-learning with students, c) encouraging students’ independent problem solving, d) building interdependence among students, and e) providing multiple other resources. Findings are discussed in relation to the literature on integrating computational thinking into content area classrooms.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is currently used as an umbrella term in education to describe the processes associated with learning and applying computer science concepts and strategies for problem-solving. Despite a growing body of literature on the subject within education and the development of a grand variety of tools designed to enhance computational thinking abilities, the relations between CT and other cognitive abilities have not been reported in young children. Understanding CT from a cognitive development perspective could be useful for creating targeted interventions tailored for young children. In the present study, we compare a previously reported computational thinking assessment with a battery of nine cognitive tests, which include fluid intelligence, working memory, planning, sequencing, mental rotation, vocabulary, and early math precursors such as numerical transcoding and symbolic magnitude comparison. Mixed-effects linear regressions were implemented with CT as a dependent variable to explore the associations between our variables. A subsample of children who participated in an educational robotics intervention were assessed in their robot programming performance, and its outcomes were compared with their CT assessments. Results suggest temporal sequencing ability and symbolic magnitude comparison are significant predictors of CT in kindergarten. Positive significant associations between robot programming and CT performance are reported.

AB  - The research aims to evaluate the effect of a robotics-based computational thinking program on executive functions and visuospatial skills in preschool children. Additionally, the study will explore the relationship between these three variables and early experiences with toys. The study will be a cluster-randomized controlled trial with pre- and post-intervention measures. Participants will be preschool children aged 5 to 6 years from both public and private institutions. The intervention will involve a new educational robotics device called ROVERSA and will consist of eight sessions distributed over four weeks, with the experimental group placed on a waitlist. To assess executive functions and visuospatial skills, standardized and validated neuropsychological measures will be used, including the Flanker task, the NIH Toolbox Card Sorting Test, the Corsi Block Test, the NEPSY-II Mental Rotation Test, the Pyramid of Mexico from the ENI-2 battery, and the Computational Thinking Test (CTt). Data analysis will begin with a hypothesis tested through ANOVA-MR, and linear regressions will be implemented to assess the relationship between variables. It is expected that the results will contribute to the discussion on teaching computational thinking and educational robotics as early learning experiences and their impact on the cognitive development of children.

AB  - Educators emphasize that computational thinking is especially helpful in raising problem-solving skills, improving logical reasoning, and developing analytical thinking. In this context, the aim of this study is to develop an online, interactive, valid, reliable and useful performance-based assessment tool for measuring computational thinking skills. Data were collected in two stages with three different measurement tools. In the data collection phase, a psychometric scale, a skill test and an interactive web application developed in this study were used. In the study in which a total of 203 high school students participated, it was determined that the students' computational thinking skills were at average level. as a result, a valid and reliable performance-based platform was developed for measuring computational thinking skills. It has also been concluded that the performance-based measurement tool makes a better measurement than the psychometric scale. It is emphasized that computational thinking should be treated as a skill or group of skills, not as a theoretical knowledge, product/portfolio or attitude/perception. Therefore, it is believed that developing performance-based tools for evaluating computational thinking skills and measuring them by using multiple measurement tools will give more accurate results. Considering the developments in computational thinking, it is thought that the study will contribute to the literature.

AB  - Computing education has progressively entered into children's early years. Due to a proliferation of computing education programs and coding tools designed for young children, research on the relationships between computational thinking (CT) and other domains of learning and development is highly warranted. Yet, there is little empirical evidence that shows the relationship between CT and children's overall cognitive functioning. As such, this study explored the relationships between Chinese children's CT and their sequencing ability and self-regulation in early childhood. One hundred and one Chinese young children (Ngirl = 52 and Nboy = 49; Mage = 5.25, SD = 0.73) were recruited and evaluated with three reliable instruments. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that: (1) CT positively predicted sequencing ability (β = 0.27, p < .05) even after controlling for relevant demographic covariates such as age, gender, and family socioeconomic status; (2) CT positively predicted self-regulation (β = 0.47, p < .001) after controlling for demographic covariates. Our findings suggest that CT may be a domain-general ability that is based on cognitive foundations that extend beyond the realm of computing.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is regarded as the conceptual basis required for identifying and solving real-world problems through algorithmic approaches to achieve transferable solutions. Developing students' CT in primary school stages is essential and has received considerable attention. Meanwhile, researchers incorporated digital badges into classrooms to improve students' learning motivation in computer science (CS). However, few solid empirical studies analyze the effects of the digital badges approach in CS education to develop students' CT. Therefore, to bridge this gap, this study designed and implemented a block-based programming course in a primary school and examined the impact of the digital badges approach on pupils' CT skills and self-efficacy and learning motivation in CS. A quasi-experimental design was conducted among 99 third-grade students across three classes. The results revealed that the adapted digital badges in primary school (1) significantly improved the students' CT skills, (2) had no significant positive impact on their CT self-efficacy or learning motivation in CS, and (3) showed no mediating effect of learning motivation on the relationship between CT skills and CT self-efficacy. In addition, we found that whether students could see only their own digital badges or also those of others had no impact on CT skills, self-efficacy, or learning motivation in CS. These findings have implications for the design of digital badge educational interventions intended to promote students' CT and learning motivation.

AB  - Computational thinking refers to a series of cognitive processes involved in solving problems through computational systems. A growing body of studies has managed to demonstrate the correlation between computational thinking and different cognitive domains. In recent decades, multiple studies have taken place that seek to evaluate the effect of computational thinking on higher-order cognitive processes. The current study aims to contribute to this discussion by analyzing the effect of an intervention program in computational thinking on the executive functions of school-age children. In this experimental study, 30 children aged 10 and 11 were randomly assigned to an experimental group and an active control group. The instruments to collect the data were 15 tests of the neuropsychological battery of executive functions and frontal lobes BANFE-2, which were applied to both groups before and after the intervention. The experimental group participated in an 8-week computational thinking intervention during which its participants enrolled in plugged and unplugged activities and carried out block programming language twice a week. The results showed that the intervention had significant effects on executive functions associated with the anterior prefrontal cortex and the dorsolateral cortex, but not those related to the orbitofrontal area.

AB  - Learning coding during early childhood is an effective way for children to practice computational thinking. Aspects of children's motivation can increase the likelihood that children approach computational thinking activities with enthusiasm and deep engagement. Gender inequities may interfere with children's readiness to take advantage of opportunities to build computational thinking skills through activities such as coding. Societal stereotypes can reduce young girls’ motivation to engage with computer science, preventing them from gaining benefits from coding activities designed to support computational thinking. This study examined children's gender stereotypes as well as children's own motivation for computer coding in 363 first- through third-grade children. We assessed gender differences in both stereotypes and motivation, as well as links between the stereotypes that individual children held and their own motivation. Children generally endorsed stereotypes about interest and ability for computer coding that favored their own-gender group, although third-grade girls reported gender-egalitarian beliefs about interest in coding. There were no gender differences in children's motivation for computer coding in terms of their own interest, sense of belonging, or ability self-concepts. Children's stereotypes about their own-gender group were significantly positively correlated with their own motivation for computer coding. These findings suggest that early childhood represents an excellent age for children to begin building computational thinking skills, before girls endorse negative stereotypes about their gender's interest in computer science.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is an essential skill students need if they are to adapt to the rise of digital society, and the evaluation of CT is crucial for enhancing students’ CT. However, the current evaluation of CT is based on a summative paradigm and ignores real CT performance during the assessment process. This study thus used a multimodal cognitive diagnostic model (H-MCDM) of students’ CT based on multimodal data in situational tasks, to achieve precise evaluation and explore the current mastery status of students’ CT and their cognitive and behavioral characteristics. The research results indicate that: 1) students’ CT was at a moderately high level and indicated a good grasp of the CT components of problem decomposition and algorithm design, but students had not yet mastered problem abstraction, 2) a total of six different CT latent patterns were discerned in the overall student results, 3) individual students who shared the same CT latent patterns could differ in their cognitive and behavioral characteristics, while those with different CT latent patterns could share similar characteristics. This study showed that it is possible to capture the degree of students’ mastery of CT and their cognitive and behavioral differences with the same or different CT latent patterns at a granular level, providing a basis for developing individualized strategies to enhance students’ CT.

AB  - In-service elementary school teachers need training to teach computational thinking (CT). A common model for CT professional learning programs includes an initial workshop followed by ongoing support. However, little research has examined the efficacy of ongoing support, the most effective types, and its impact on classroom practices. The current study details a multifaceted CT professional learning program with innovative ongoing support to help elementary school teachers implement the Code.org curriculum. It also empirically investigated the impact of the support on teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT, the effectiveness of each component of the support, and to what extent it affected teachers' classroom practices. Our ongoing support included an additional workshop, grade-level professional learning community (PLC) sessions, instructional videos, and teacher leaders' support. Data included a pre-survey, four post-surveys, lesson observations, a focus group interview, tracking the number of video views, and surveys from PLC participants and teacher leaders. Results indicated that the ongoing support significantly increased teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT. Regarding the effectiveness of the various components of the ongoing support, the additional workshop significantly increased teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT. Teachers valued each component of the support, and this support improved teachers’ classroom practices.

AB  - The present study investigates the debugging process of 526 children in preschool (4–6 aged) when programming a tangible robot. When a child is involved in programming, it is needed to identify and correct errors, or in other words, debug a program. Debugging is a high-level thinking skill and is an essential component closely related to developing Computational Thinking in early childhood education. Though the debugging process is a cognitive function in programming investigated by many researchers in recent decades, most studies are conducted either in primary, secondary education, or higher education concerning beginners or experts in programming. Very few reviews, and some focus on preschool education. Our study set out the following objectives: 1) How do children identify the existence of error and locate it? 2) What types of errors emerge when coding? 3) What type of error is complex for novice programmers? 4) What strategies are developed by novice programmers to debug effectively? and 5) What types of knowledge do novice programmers construct by debugging the tangible robot Bee-Bot? The study follows an iterative model of a design-based research approach. It uses multiple case studies to collect qualitative and quantitative data. The programming intervention was implemented by 30 educators in their classrooms and was based on a scenario-based teaching design. The debugging process was analysed using Klahr & Craven's framework (1988): 1) test and evaluate program, 2) identify bug, 3) represent program, 4) locate bug and 5) correct bug. The main finding is the construction and development of syntactic and semantic knowledge.

AB  - A plethora of programming platforms purports to teach preschool-aged children computational thinking (CT) and coding skills. However, the empirical evidence to support their effectiveness is still in its early stages. A three-week didactic intervention using ScratchJr was conducted to investigate its effectiveness in fostering CT and rudimentary coding skills in a cohort of preschool children (N = 34, aged 4–6 years). While the initial performance mean of the control group (M = 7.07, SD = 2.58) exhibits a statistically significant elevation t (22.64 = 2.23, p = 0.036) vis-à-vis the experimental group (M = 5.35, SD = 1.58), t (22.64) = 2.23, p = 0.0 the terminal performance means of both groups converge closely. However, meticulous data analysis unveils a statistically notable enhancement among preschool participants exposed to the educational intervention involving ScratchJr. Notably, both instructional modalities appear commensurate in nurturing elementary computational tenets, namely modularity and control structures. The experimental cohort outperforms the control group with statistical significance in comprehending potent ideational constructs encompassing representation, algorithms, and hardware/software interplay. Conversely, the control group performs better in grasping the debugging concept than their experimental counterparts. The outcomes lend substantive credence to the efficacy of the distinct programming milieu offered by ScratchJr, underscoring its effectiveness in cultivating CT and coding proficiencies within the preschool demographic.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is crucial for students. Robot-supported learning has emerged as a popular approach for CT cultivation. To understand the effects of robot-supported CT cultivation, the current study conducted a meta-analysis to analyze studies from Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Science Direct databases (2012–2022) which screened using keywords ``computational thinking'' and ``robot''. After further screening, 26 peer-reviewed articles were selected. We synthesized the 33 effect sizes to assess the overall effectiveness of robot-supported learning on CT and its sub-dimensions: concepts, practices, and perspectives. Our findings revealed a medium effect of robot-supported learning on students' CT (g = 0.643), a large effect on CT concepts (g = 0.650), a medium effect on CT practices (g = 0.587), and a huge effect on CT perspectives (g = 1.419). We also explored the moderators (i.e., grade level, study duration, culture, learning strategy, and assessment tool) that might influence the effects of robot-supported CT cultivation. Moderator analyses indicated that short-term (less than four weeks) robot-supported learning had a larger effect (g = 0.901) on CT practice than long-term (more than eleven weeks) learning (g = 0.309). This meta-analysis indicates that educators could apply robot-supported learning to cultivate students' CT and concludes with related implications.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has gained increasing recognition as a 21st-century competency. Although initiatives have been taken to define the term for educational practices, limited empirical evidence is available to clarify its underlying components, especially at the primary education level. This study aimed to identify the associations between CT and specific cognitive skills in the primary school context. Based on the literature, three cognitive domains were studied (i.e., mathematical, visuospatial, and reasoning skills) and standard test batteries were applied to a sample of 633 primary students (aged 7–12 years). Linear regression analyses were performed with CT performance as the dependent variable to investigate its associations with the measured cognitive skills, and demographic features (i.e., age, gender) and coding learning experience (i.e., years of coding experience, extra-curricular coding experience) were included as control variables. The results indicated that the students’ CT performance was significantly predicted by their attainments in numeracy, visual perception, spatial visualisation, and inductive reasoning, and the results remained significant after controlling for demographics and coding experience. The study adds to the literature by enriching the understanding of CT as a psychological construct and has practical implications for educational stakeholders regarding the importance of interdisciplinary teaching and the integration of specific cognitive skills into CT learning activities.

AB  - The sustainable and digital future of work may imply a dramatic equilibrium change between social factors and technological ones. We argue that providing suitable tools to support End-User Development (EUD) in the workplace could represent a way to cope with such future changes. The contributions of this paper include the analysis and characterization of the most used EUD techniques and their crossover with a new conveyed model of Computational Thinking. The synthesis between these aspects is made explicit in the construct of EUDability, which is designed to capture the quality dimensions of EUD systems suitable to work scenarios where better roles and better tools for individuals may be shaped. EUDability has to do with identifying and assessing the difficulties of EUD techniques on one side and the Computational Thinking skills held by individuals on the other side.

AB  - There has been an increasing interest in the integration of technology into language education. Meanwhile, computational thinking (CT) skills are fostered which influence communicative language teaching and learning. Despite CT's established importance in science education, its significance in language teaching remains scarce. This study contributes to knowledge synthesis and methodological development by reviewing 16 journal articles, analyzing CT applications in language learning across educational contexts, intervention tools, CT skills, language acquisition, and assessment methods. The results indicate that (a) more CT-involved activities are needed for primary, secondary, and tertiary education, (b) educational robots and Scratch stand out as the most trending intervention tools, (c) CT skills such as decomposition, abstraction, generalization and so on have a positive effect on students’ foreign language acquisition, especially in grammar and writing, (d) assessment of CT development can be surveyed through a validated and reliable instrument such as computer programming self-efficacy scale or an online platform: Dr. Scratch; Conversely, there is a diversity of evaluation tools in foreign language learning. This study is the first to review experimental research on integrating computational thinking into foreign language learning and offers significant implications for future research.

AB  - The development of programming skills and computational thinking in the formal educational context is one of the most recent horizons set by many educational systems worldwide. Although the first computational thinking initiatives are being applied from the earliest school ages, this research focuses on the secondary education level. Specifically, the objective is the following: to analyse the implementation of Arduino, as well as the benefits and opportunities it brings to secondary school students. For this purpose, documentary research has been undertaken applying a systematic review according to the PRISMA 2020 framework following the PiCoS strategy. Atlas.ti 9 was used to analyse the information. Out of 316 papers identified, 37 were included in the research. In relation to the results, Arduino is primarily used in technology and physics subjects, although it is also used to develop interdisciplinary STEAM projects. As a rule, it is used to learn programming languages, but likewise as a resource to develop science experiments. LED lights, servomotors and breadboards are among the most commonly used resources together with the Arduino board. and Scratch was the most widely used software. The initiatives implemented have yielded both positive and negative results, for example, one drawback is that some projects are very difficult, and some achievements such as: increased motivation towards the contents addressed or also the development of some soft skills, such as problem solving.

AB  - Recently, virtual reality (VR) technology has shown great potential in advancing education with many pedagogical benefits for building the 21st-century teaching and learning experience. This study conducted a formative evaluation of an immersive VR expedition application with the aim of understanding users' learning processes and how the application facilitates higher education students' computational thinking skills. Six participants were randomly selected to conduct this evaluation. A mixed research approach consisting of quantitative and qualitative methods was employed. The study quantitatively analyzed users' scores from gameplay to understand how the intervention supported computational thinking skills. Participants were also interviewed to collect data after playing the mini-games to investigate users' experiences. The study showcases players' computational thinking competency, assessed automatically during gameplay. Further, this study used inductive content analysis to demonstrate users' reactions to prototyped VR mini-games. The qualitative findings suggest that users found the VR mini-games interactive and immersive, which provided an opportunity to foster learners' computational thinking skills. The quantitative analysis revealed that student's computational thinking competency can be enhanced through consistent playing of the mini-games. Moreover, the expedition aspect of the VR game stimulated learners' curiosity, which sustained their learning progress. Furthermore, users gained new knowledge and found the mini-games educative. Nevertheless, several aspects of the VR mini-games need improvements, according to users' perceptions. This study contributes to the knowledge in terms of the affordances of VR in education research and provides relevant insights that can shape future studies, for example, the recent hype of metaverse in education.

AB  - Project-Based Learning (PBL) and Computational Thinking (CT), a teaching strategy and a problem-solving method, respectively, have been widely used in teaching and learning because of their educational advantages for students and teachers. However, studies of their integration into the teaching and learning process have been scarce, resulting in a lack of guidance for educators to implement such an approach that apply constructivism learning theory. This study aims to systematically review and identify appropriate frameworks, models, techniques and tools that could guide the successful implementation of PBL-CT. This study examined relevant articles published from 2017 to 2021 to highlight the gaps in the PBL-CT execution and map their backgrounds into a coherent taxonomy that could help guide the directions of future studies. As revealed, none of such articles explicitly explain any suitable PBL-CT frameworks or models. The study identified several common elements for the PBL-CT framework formulation, indicating scaffolding and inquiry are the most commonly applied techniques, with visual tools dominating the PBL-CT implementation. Most articles involved computing, followed by STEM, with a few originating from non-STEM fields. Several important implications could help educators develop an effective PBL-CT course design and provide some guidelines for future research. An effective PBL-CT integration enhances teaching and learning besides improving students' computational thinking skills. Thinking skills are critical 21st-century skills needed for students' success.

AB  - Computational thinking has become an integral component of curricula worldwide, necessitating teachers to develop this competence in their students. To effectively meet these curricular requirements, teachers themselves need a solid foundation of computational thinking content knowledge, which refers to the understanding and skills they possess in this area. However, despite widespread recognition of this need, few studies have rigorously examined teachers' content knowledge in this domain. Addressing this gap requires the development of high-quality measurement tools. This study details the development of an instrument, created as part of the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) 2023 in Flanders, to measure lower secondary school teachers' computational thinking content knowledge in a valid and reliable way. The article first outlines the construction process of the instrument, which involved close collaboration with experts in the field and drew upon the framework of Fraillon et al. (2023). Following this, the instrument's psychometric properties are presented, which include both item-level and overall instrument characteristics. These properties were evaluated using data from a sample of 352 participants, applying both Classical Test Theory and Item Response Theory. The final tool consists of sixteen multiple-choice and short constructed response questions. The results indicate favorable item and overall instrument characteristics, thereby affirming its potential to measure the intended construct in a valid and accurate way.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) skills help students both understand and utilize computing in various domains to cope with the challenges posed by the complex digital world. This study applied mind mapping to programming language instruction in a primary school, and explored the effects of mind mapping on students' CT skills when learning programming with Scratch as a programming tool. Two types of mind mapping, construct-by-self mind mapping (CBS-MM) and construct-on-scaffold mind mapping (COS-MM), were proposed to compare which type is more effective in terms of students' CT skills. Seventy-three public primary school fifth-grade students aged 10 to 11 participated in the study. The CBS group included 33 students learning with the CBS-MM instructional approach, while the COS group comprised 40 students learning with the COS-MM instructional approach. Data were obtained from nine topic Scratch programming assignments and pre- and post-CT skills surveys completed by the two groups. Paired sample t tests were used to analyze whether the two types of mind mapping approach could improve both groups' CT skills. One-way ANCOVA and one-way ANOVA were used to examine the difference in the two groups' CT skills. The results showed that both CBS-MM and COS-MM can improve students' CT skills; however, the COS group students could better improve their CT skills with the assistance of the COS-MM method compared with the CBS group students who learned with the CBS-MM method. The findings of this study can provide some enlightenment for relevant instructors to design instruction and implement programming teaching with different kinds of mind mapping support that facilitates students’ CT.

AB  - The specific mechanisms by which teachers and parents can provide culturally relevant opportunities for computational thinking for racially/ethnically and linguistically diverse groups of preschoolers remain unknown. Accordingly, the purpose of this research is to examine how PreK parent and teacher voice directed efforts to realize a culturally relevant computing program. We drew data sources from a subsample of design-based research meetings in which partners collaborated to co-develop the first iteration of the program. Using qualitative analysis, we examined how parent voice and teacher voice, conceptualized as perspectives and participation, influenced theories of culturally responsive computing and computational thinking in early childhood education and the translation of theory into practice in classroom and home settings. Findings showed that connecting powerful ideas from computational thinking, namely algorithms and problem solving (e.g., debugging), to familiar activities and experiences served as a powerful entry point. Yet, differences arose in how teachers and parents conceptualized culturally relevant computing and made connections to familiar routines. We discuss what can be learned from parent voice in regards to bolstering children's self-expression, access to increasingly complex computational thinking tasks, and opportunities for learning cultural and community values through computing.

AB  - In recent years, the development of computational thinking (CT) has become integral to many school curricula worldwide. This has been associated with calls for computational thinking to be considered a ‘21St Century’ competency, valuable to all students as a transferable process for solving problems and building understanding of human behaviour and systems. However, while computational thinking is a focus of most secondary school computer science curricula, proponents such as Jeanette Wing argue its relevance for younger students, indicating more work must be done investigating its development in early years' education. This study used a structured, problem-based curriculum supported by guided inquiry pedagogy, to explore 6 year old students' learning of basic computational thinking concepts and practices while coding programmable floor robots (Blue-bots and an iPad app). Results indicated improvement across the seven lessons in students' sequencing/algorithm authoring, error correction, and pattern recognition. Furthermore, they revealed evidence of higher order thinking such as identifying patterns in code, and how these can be transferred to help solve problems of different designs. While currently play-based approaches are used to introduce computational thinking concepts and practices in early years' education, results from this study suggest that more structured, problem-based methods should be seriously considered. Results challenge commonly understood developmental theories about what young children can and can't do, contextualised within the field of computer science, and hold implications for early years' teachers' professional knowledge and pedagogy if they are to promote their students' learning in this increasingly important area. Given rapid technological advancements such as artificial intelligence (AI) and increasingly earlier exposure of young children to digitally-mediated information, this study provides support for the earlier and more systematic introduction of basic digital literacy knowledge and skills in early years' education.

In this study, we investigated the robots used, proposed activities, and evaluation processes. We also analyzed research contexts and the stated motivations to conduct the studies. Our review identified characteristics of the robots, such as input and output interfaces, cost, and availability. We also categorized activities considering context, modality of work, type of activities, duration, adults’ role, scaffolding, unplugged activities, explicit debugging, communication and sharing instances, and teaching knowledge from other domains. We analyzed the computational thinking evaluation process looking at types of assessments, asset concepts, and research design. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of existing research, identifies existing gaps, and provides recommendations for future studies.

AB  - The integration of computational thinking (CT) into K-12 education offers substantial potential to improve digital literacy and deepen students’ understanding across various subject areas. By embedding computational procedures and solution-oriented approaches into traditional curricula, students can develop essential skills that are critical for thriving in an increasingly digital world. However, the effective integration of CT into subject-specific learning poses challenges for educators, largely due to a lack of training and experience in implementing interdisciplinary instructional strategies. This study explores the impact of integrating CT into K-12 education through diverse instructional approaches, including modelling, storytelling, and unplugged activities. The research examines how students' subject knowledge, CT concepts, and practices evolved under each CT integration practice, as well as their acceptance toward CT integrated lessons. The study was conducted in different subjects, including language arts, biology, and physics, and at different grade levels. The technology acceptance model was used as a theoretical framework to understand students' adoption towards the different integration practices. The study revealed that different CT integration practices yield varying impacts on students' attitudes, particularly in relation to their prior programming experiences. Namely, primary school students with prior programming experience display a higher behavioural intention due to a lack of early biases toward programming. Conversely, secondary school students, less familiar with interdisciplinary approaches, initially show less enthusiasm for future engagement. These insights underscore the need for tailored instructional strategies that consider students' prior experiences and the broader goal of preparing them to contribute to a technologically driven society.

AB  - As we begin to identify essential skills for the future, there has been an increased focus on how to define and implement computational thinking within education. However, the question of how to engage children with coding activities within the context and limitations of the curriculum remains relatively explored. In our study, a human-centered design approach was followed to guide a small group of children through the co-design, implementation and evaluation of a board game. The board game had two versions: an offline version involving a robotic agent and an online version with its digital equivalent. A mixed-method approach was used to understand and compare levels of engagement, usability, and collaboration in both versions of the game. The tangible aspect of working with a robotic agent in the offline version led to greater levels of motivation and involvement with the game mechanics. Tangible robotics games tend to be more approachable for children. Our study shows that using such games by connecting the mathematics curriculum with coding problems can successfully engage participants in collaborative computational thinking activities. We contribute to the field by providing human-centered guidance for the creation of educational tools to develop computational thinking. Such guidance is not only applicable in technologically rich environments; it can also be applied in educational communities with limited access to technology.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has been relevant in teaching STEM courses, and educators are incorporating both plugged and unplugged CT activities in their modules to prepare new entrants for advanced knowledge. However, additional empirical data are needed to understand how an unplugged activities approach can lead to an improved understanding of CT concepts. Therefore, this study investigates the impact of unplugged activities on novice students' CT skills and unravels the characteristics of students' CT competency from performing unplugged activities. The experimental aspect of this study was conducted with a cohort of 210 students participating in an introductory programming course at a University in Nigeria. A mixed-method research approach and a quasi-experimental design were applied in this study to understand how the unplugged approach in teaching CT could help students improve their CT competency. A paired-sample t-test of familiarity score for each CT concept showed a significant increase in the score before and after the intervention. Furthermore, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was used for topic modeling of the text describing students’ solutions. Topic modeling allows for more insights into the steps taken by the students to solve CT problems. Only 27.62 % of students' solution descriptions contained CT concepts, 56.90 % of the students solved the puzzle with an optimal score, and 72.41 % of students who applied CT concepts of problem abstraction and decomposition were able to solve the puzzle correctly. Indeed, CT unplugged activities significantly increased the number of students who gained CT competency. In addition, this study provides recommendation for computer science educators and highlight future direction.

AB  - Computational thinking is a fundamental competence that is being introduced in K-12 and succeeding curricula worldwide. Despite this huge effort, many computational thinking models in the literature do not explicitly take into consideration the pupils’ age and the developmental nature of computational thinking skills. Furthermore, many existing computational thinking models are focused on the internal thinking processes of the individuals, failing to explicitly consider the situated nature, in terms of social context and artefactual environment, that usually characterise tasks that require computational thinking to be solved. In this paper, we present a framework for the design, realisation, analysis, and assessment of computational thinking activities, called CT-cube. The CT-cube allows to extend existing computational thinking models to consider the life-long development of computational thinking skills in individuals, from childhood to adult age, and to take into consideration the situated nature of computational thinking activities. We use the CT-cube to design an unplugged task, called Cross Array Task (CAT), allowing to assess the algorithmic skills of K-12 pupils and we show how the CT-cube can be used in this case to illustrate the development of this competence along the entire compulsory school path, considering a sample of 109 pupil aged 3 to 16 in Switzerland.

AB  - The current single teaching and assessing modes of English as a foreign language (EFL) grammar in China have caused the disconnect between grammar knowledge and competency with numerous errors in essay writing, somehow ignoring the analysis of learners thinking patterns. To solve the problem, computational thinking (CT), a higher-order thinking in solving problems and optimizing the way to acquire knowledge, was employed in the study. As needed, the experimental group was taught using the CT teaching model following CT principal elements (data analysis, pattern recognition, abstraction, decomposition, and parallelization), while the control group followed the traditional teaching mode. Quantitative and qualitative data were obtained based on the pre-test-post-test, classroom observation, and questionnaire survey. The results show that the grammar application in short essay writing of all the members of the experimental group significantly improved and that higher grammar learning agency and engagement were unfolded to show the changes of thinking patterns. However, not all the members from the control group showed similar results. CT serves as an important social mediation tool in EFL teaching. This study further enriches the teaching modes of grammar and is an effective attempt at introducing CT into learners’ thinking patterns.

AB  - With growing interest in supporting the development of computational thinking (CT) in early childhood, there is also need for new assessments that serve multiple purposes and uses. In particular, there is a need to understand the design of formative assessments that can be used during classroom instruction to provide feedback to teachers and children in real-time. In this paper, we report on an empirical study and advance a new unit of observational analysis for formative assessment that we call an indicator of a knowledge refinement opportunity or as a shorthand, KRO indicators. We put forth a new framework for conceptualizing the design of formative assessments that builds on the Evidence Centered Design framework but centers identification and analysis of indicators of knowledge refinement opportunities. We illustrate a number of key indicators through empirical examples drawn from video recordings of Kindergarten classroom lessons.

AB  - Interest in coding education has exploded in the past five years, especially in elementary and early secondary education. Teachers who are largely new to coding are expected to guide entire student bodies through the fundamentals of coding and computational thinking. But little is known about which coding and computational thinking (CT) concepts teachers feel most comfortable with and which concepts they struggle with. This study describes 127 elementary coding teachers’ changes in their beliefs about teaching coding and CT as they participated in year-long continuous professional development. Novice elementary coding teachers demonstrated most growth in their self-efficacy for teaching sequences, algorithms and loops. They were less secure in their knowledge of conditionals, variables, and functions. For computational thinking, teachers were most confident in their ability to identify patterns, think algorithmically, understand logic, and evaluate outcomes, showing less growth with decomposition and abstraction.

AB  - This study compares the effects of coding education with educational robot and unplugged coding activities on pre-school students' computational thinking and executive function skills. This study used a pre-test and post-test comparison group quasi-experimental design. The study was conducted in a public kindergarten with 48 pre-school students (24 educational robot- BeeBot® group and 24-unplugged coding group) aged 5-6. The TechCheck-K test was used to measure computational thinking skills, and Executive Functions Battery-Computerized Touch was used to measure executive function skills. The process started with pre-test applications and ended with post-tests after four weeks (16 different sessions) of the implementation in both groups. The study found a statistically significant difference between the computational thinking pre-test and post-test scores of pre-school students in both groups in favor of the post-test. It was determined that there was a statistically significant difference in favor of the educational robot group between the post-test scores of computational thinking skills. In addition, when the findings regarding executive functions were evaluated, there was a statistically significant difference between the pre-test and post-test scores of total executive function in favor of the post-test in both groups. However, it was observed that there was no statistically significant difference between the post-test scores of both groups in terms of total executive function skills scores. In addition, when the post-test scores of pre-school students in two groups were evaluated, it was determined that there was no significant difference in computational thinking and executive function skills according to gender. Consequently, it was determined that coding education with an educational robot was more effective for gaining computational thinking skills than unplugged coding activities for pre-school students. However, it was observed that there was no difference between the two groups in terms of the development of executive function skills in pre-school education.

AB  - Since environmental and energy issues and challenges continues to emerge as key global concerns, Green Building Certification Systems are becoming increasingly relevant in the construction industry. In this regard, LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is considered one of the most widely recognized environmental assessment methods used globally in the construction industry today. However, due to the high level of complexity of the LEED system, the tools usually used to verify the achievement of the credits lack of “design friendliness” and hardly communicate effectively with the conventional tools used by architects and engineers (e.g. CAD, BIM). This makes difficult to fully take into account, especially at the early design stage, the many interconnected aspects that contribute to the green certification, with consequent issues often arising in the design validation and/or construction phases, resulting in time delays and cost increments. The application of innovative problem-solving methods, such as computational thinking, together with coding techniques, represents an effective way to deal with this issue. This kind of methodology, in fact, allows the requirements of a specific LEED credit to be digitally parametrised and flexibly incorporated into a “designer friendly” working environment. In particular, Visual Programming Languages (VPLs), due to their high simplicity of usage, allow architects and engineers to develop algorithms and thus implement their technical knowledge in the field of environmental design with computer programming skills, useful to improve their tools and keep them constantly updated. The aim of this paper is to illustrate a methodology through which, by merging computational thinking strategies with VPL tools, is possible to keep under control, in the same working environment, all the parameters required to verify in real time the achievement of LEED credits. To demonstrate the flexibility of the approach, dedicated tools developed for the verification of some specific credits at different scales – neighbourhood and building – are illustrated as operational examples of the proposed methodology.

AB  - Computational thinking, defined by Wing (2011) as the “thought processes involved in formulating problems … so that the solutions are represented in a form that can effectively be carried out by an information-processing agent,” has become the central construct of K12 computing education around the world. This article provides a history of computational thinking, a summary of computational thinking's role in educational policy and practice, role as a research construct, and concludes by considering the future of computational thinking. The debate over how to define and teach computational thinking can be understood as a proxy for the broader questions about education.

AB  - Collecting and organizing data to understand and answer real-world questions is an increasingly important skill in our current world. Fostering data collection and analysis (DCA) skills in young children leverages key mathematics skills as well as the data representation, visualization, and interpretation skills of computational thinking (CT), culminating in a problem-solving approach with data. As such, the intervention, comprising investigations and a digital app, supported preschool teachers and children to answer data-focused questions by engaging in each step of the DCA process in order to foster CT and math skills. Teachers appreciated that the app offers a new way for children to visualize data and noted that the app provided learning opportunities for children that would not otherwise be possible or easy to implement. Results also suggest that the app provides a systematic process for data collection, entry, and interpretation. Children in classrooms that completed the intervention had significantly higher scores at post-intervention compared to children in classrooms that did not complete the intervention, controlling for pre-intervention scores, B(SE) = 0.13(0.05), t (6) = 2.48, p = .048.

AB  - Computational Thinking (CT), the conceptual foundations required for solving complex problems effectively and efficiently, is an imperative skill for today's learners, across disciplines and across ages. As for its importance in the wide network of digital literacies, CT has been implemented in various educational contexts, however mostly via digital artifacts, specifically in programming-related activities. This approach does not fulfill the potential of such integration for promoting learning. In this paper, we argue that digital literacies should not be bound to the digital realm, and present a novel approach to fully integrate CT into learning and teaching by the development of CT-infused “unplugged” pedagogical tools that are fully embedded in the subject matter. We demonstrate the advantages to student learning of these tools in two case studies from K-12 mathematics education: 1) An assistive tool for function investigation in high-school calculus – in this case, we point out to how CT skills that were implemented in the tool promoted students' problem solving; 2) A teaching unit for pattern sequences in elementary school – in this case, we show how students in the CT research group outperformed students in the other groups, and how they implemented CT to solve pattern sequence problems effectively and efficiently. We highlight that besides enhancing learning, this approach can help address the important issue of equity in education, and suggest ways to promote it via dedicated professional development.

AB  - Creativity and Computational Thinking (CT) have been pointed out as two important skills that would promote students in the digital age as contributing members of society. Therefore, these two constructs have been extensively researched in recent years, but the associations between them are yet to be fully understood. This study takes another step towards bridging this gap by examining the association between CT and three types of creativity, i.e., Figural Creative Thinking, Verbal Creative Thinking, and Computational Creativity. Data was collected from 119 ninth-grade students (14–15 years old) from Israel. Students took two commonly used creativity tests (Torrance's Test of Creative Thinking, and the Alternative Uses Test). They also used Kodetu—an online learning environment for CT—and we used the system log files to measure their CT acquirement and their computational creativity. Findings suggest some nuanced associations between the four sets of variables. Specifically, we point out the limited associations between verbal and figural creativities, some of which are negative; also, we found that the associations between creative thinking and CT, as well as between creative thinking and computational creativity, differ by gender.

AB  - Many studies have demonstrated that Virtual Exchange (VE) for teaching languages can have a positive effect on learners' intercultural awareness or achievements. However, during this century, the teaching process has shifted from teaching with technology to solving problems with it. In this regard, pedagogical experts in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) have developed programming and robotics based on Computational Thinking skills (CTs), which have been regarded as the core of 21st-century skills. In the field of CALL, this skill has received very little attention. Accordingly, we have attempted to switch the process and outcome of language learning in VE. Thus, we developed the conceptual framework that integrated CTsCALL and Individual-technology-task-environment Fit (ITTEF). Having designed our VE tasks based on CTsCALL, we provided the opportunity for 92 Spanish language learners in our project to exchange language and culture with Cypriot and Irish students and solve VE tasks based on CTsCALL. The result of the symmetric phase of the study validated the five-dimensional structure of CTsCALL and the four-dimensional structures of ITTEF in VE and CALL. It also revealed that language learners, who focused on the key information rather than the details while solving language tasks, as well as recognizing the pattern of task solving and applying them to other tasks, found VE, and CTsCALL to be aligned with their current capabilities, learning environment, and problem-solving skills that mediated their intention to learn and exchange information in this context in the future. Furthermore, the asymmetrical part of the study revealed that sixteen solutions are available to shape language learners' continued intention to use VE by combining the components of CTsCALL and ITTEF. Thus, the study developed the CTsCALL questionnaire and its theory into CALL together with the Council of Europe's Common European Framework of Reference for Languages and recommended that CALL researchers and educators take a broader view of VE, as well as continuing to validate CTsCALL in other CALL disciplines to show that this skill belongs to CALL as well.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is gaining increasing attention from researchers and practitioners all over the world to empower children in the digital era. However, there is no consensus on which components of CT to teach beginning coders in early childhood education (ECE). To address this issue, we conducted a systematic review of 42 empirical studies focused on teaching and assessing CT in ECE. We analyzed the included studies with the three-dimensional CT framework proposed by Brennan and Resnick (2012) and demonstrated how this framework could be modified to fit the context of ECE. Based on this systematic review, we sorted out the CT components that were proven suitable for young children to learn by incorporating emerging components and removing components inappropriate for young children. We thus proposed a CT curriculum framework for ECE that covers CT concepts (i.e., control flow/structures, representation, and hardware/software), CT practices (i.e., algorithmic design, pattern recognition, abstraction, debugging, decomposition, iteration, and generalizing), and CT perspectives (i.e., expressing and creating, connecting, perseverance, and choices of conduct). This systematic review and its associated CT curriculum framework provide important theoretical contributions and practical implications for early childhood CT education.

AB  - In this paper, we review and meta-analyze the findings of experimental studies published between 2006 and 2022 that examined the effects of coding and programming interventions on children's core and higher order executive functions (response inhibition, working memory, cognitive flexibility, planning and problem solving). The systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to address three research questions: 1) Which executive functions are most impacted by the teaching of CT? 2) Which instructional modality (educational robotics/virtual coding/unplugged coding) is most effective in enhancing executive function skills in learners aged 4–16 years? and 3) Does the cognitive effectiveness of coding vary with children's age? A total of 19 studies with 1523 participants met the selection criteria for the systematic review. The meta-analysis included 11 of those studies. The results reveal beneficial effects of structured virtual and tangible coding (educational robotics) activities for preschoolers and first graders, and significant effects of more unstructured virtual coding activities (e.g., Scratch-based) for older students. A multivariate fixed-effects model meta-analysis shows that the teaching of coding significantly improves problem-solving with the highest effect (dppc2 = 0.89), but also planning (dppc2 = 0.36), and inhibition and working memory with lower effects (dppc2 = 0.17, dppc2 = 0.20).

AB  - In light of the increasing importance digital economy, the significance of computational thinking has grown exponentially, becoming imperative in both workplace and academic settings such as universities. This article addresses the critical need to comprehend the factors influencing the acceptance of computational thinking. The dataset introduces an extensive questionnaire comprising five constructs and 25 items, rooted in the extended Technology Acceptance Model. Notably, the model incorporates facilitating conditions and subjective norm, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding acceptance. Data collection involved 132 undergraduate university students sampled through purposive sampling, specifically targeting courses with a focus on computational thinking. The resulting dataset serves as a valuable resource for future research, offering detailed insights into the factors determining the acceptance of technology in educational contexts beyond mere thinking skills. Given the scarcity of research on technology acceptance in developing nations, this dataset holds particular significance, serving as a foundation for potential cross-cultural comparisons. The dataset contributes to the field by presenting a robust acceptance model, explaining 74.2 per cent of the variance in behavioural intention, 60.2 per cent in perceived usefulness, and 56.1 per cent in perceived ease of use. This high explanatory power positions the dataset as a superior resource for replication, benchmarking, and broader applicability in diverse contexts, thereby enhancing the understanding of computational thinking acceptance across different populations and settings. This dataset stands among the pioneering efforts to assess the novel covariance-based structural equation model algorithm within SmartPLS 4, presenting a valuable resource for future research employing the same mechanism.

AB  - This paper describes a study designed to investigate the promise of resources that support the development of computational thinking (CT) in preschool children. This study was the culmination of a collaborative research process between researchers and media developers of a home-based intervention that included media and hands-on activities created to support the development of young children's CT. The mixed-methods study included 108 families, each with a 4- or 5-year-old child. Families, who participated in the study at home for six weeks, were randomly assigned to an intervention group that viewed media and engaged with hands-on activities with a CT focus or a control group that viewed and engaged with non-STEM literacy content. Data collection consisted of parent surveys, parent interviews, and CT learning and pre-coding tasks to assess children's CT abilities. Results indicate that the learning intervention demonstrates promise in supporting parental understanding of CT. Experience with the intervention over the six weeks also appeared to cultivate some CT strategy use in children as evidenced by parental reports and performance on learning and pre-coding sequencing tasks.

AB  - This study characterizes the literature on teaching computational thinking (CT) to preschoolers aged 4 to 5 years. Previous research and published systematic studies have provided important contributions about CT teaching to elementary and high school children. However, to date, there is no systematic overview of CT education for preschoolers. For this reason, this systematic mapping synthesizes 82 studies on CT teaching, through the implementation and evaluation of tools and activities to teach, improve or measure the CT knowledge acquired by children. Furthermore, studies on courses or training offered to preschool teachers related to the teaching of CT were also considered. From the selected studies, the following information was collected: year of publication; recovery sources and databases; vehicles and places of publication; temporal delimitation of research, research approach, nature and research method; CT teaching approaches; tools used to teach CT and how they are classified according to their physical characteristics and, finally, participants and individuals responsible for the research. The results suggest an increase in the number of publications in recent years, revealing the interest of researchers in the topic. Furthermore, we observed a trend towards the use of physical artifacts and the use of the disconnected computing approach to teaching CT skills to preschool children. The results also exposed that preschool teachers have little autonomy in implementing CT teaching activities because those are mostly implemented by computer professionals (researchers, teachers, etc.). This is because preschool teachers are still discouraged from teaching computer and technology-related content to children, considering them complex and disconnected from basic curricula. However, when teachers are trained to teach CT, they become interested in the content and become more active during the teaching process. We argue for integrating CT-related content into education curricula and supporting preschool teachers to implement it autonomously in their classrooms.

AB  - This paper deals within a context where technology plays a pivotal role in education. In this sense, it is essential to highlight the emergence of new competencies and skills in education due to technological advancements. Legislative frameworks have been developed to incorporate digital literacy, access to robotics, and computational thinking, between others. Hence, this review and meta-analysis aim at identifying the influence of robotics activities on computational thinking through a PRISMA-guided review. The findings reveal that interventions conducted in early childhood education significantly impact computational thinking. Results also showcase that, despite perceived barriers related to technology accessibility, the presence of legislation and contexts prioritizing these competencies is more relevant than the digital access gap.

AB  - Since computational thinking is a high-level cognitive skill and its conceptual framework has not yet been clarified, the assessment of this skill is problematic. While there is no consensus in the literature about the components of computational thinking, the abstraction component is located at a point where opinions intersect. In addition, it is predicted that computer science unplugged activities will improve computational thinking, and there is limited research examining this effect. As a result, this research aims to demonstrate the alleged effects of computer science unplugged activities on abstraction skill which is considered the critical component of computational thinking. The study, which was planned with a mixed methods research design, lasted 8 weeks. Quantitative data were obtained from the abstraction skill test developed by the researchers, while qualitative data were obtained from observations and task- based interviews after each activity. Quantitative findings showed that computer science unplugged activities significantly improve abstraction skills and thus computational thinking. Qualitative findings not only revealed that developments in the six abstracting steps caused this significant difference but also identified abstracting steps where the effect of each activity was limited. Suggestions for organizing activities to improve these steps are given. Finally, suggestions are presented for the conceptual framework of computational thinking based on abstraction.

AB  - The healthy development of cognitive functions, including executive functions, has been shown to depend mainly on the experiences and learning opportunities of people, especially during childhood. Over the past few years, researchers have been studying the impacts of diverse types of interventions on children’s cognitive development in which computational thinking programs are a recent field. This pilot study evaluated the effect of computational thinking training based on the “Programming for Children” program on the executive functions of children aged 10 and 11 years: working memory, inhibition, and planning (N = 30). The results showed that children in the experimental group improved on tests of visuospatial working memory, cognitive inhibition, and sequential planning compared with the control group. However, tests of verbal working memory, memory strategy, and visual spatial planning did not show any observed changes. Although this was an exploratory study, and its findings should be interpreted cautiously due to the small sample size, the findings support the relevance and feasibility of conducting similar larger studies with larger samples.

AB  - Computational thinking has been promoted as an impactful 21st-century skillset that can be transferred to many other disciplines and problem scenarios. With the proliferation of age-appropriate coding platforms for young children, computational thinking has become increasingly popular in early childhood settings. However, there is a lack of research on introducing coding and computational thinking to teacher training in early childhood education. To empower early childhood teachers in the digital society, this study introduced 17 early childhood teachers to robot programming and computational thinking through the ‘CT4ECE’ professional development program, which includes three phases: Learn, Practice, and Reflect & Improve. Results of pre- and post-intervention surveys revealed that the CT4ECE program significantly enhanced teachers' robotics and pedagogical knowledge, as well as their attitudes towards computational thinking, especially their interest in and their view of using computational thinking in classroom practice. Post-intervention interviews indicated that participation in CT4ECE helped educators gain a basic understanding of both coding robots and computational thinking suitable for young children due to a structured change process for teachers' professional learning. This study establishes a strong foundation for enhancing and expanding the CT4ECE program, ultimately equipping teachers and children with the necessary skillsets to thrive in the digital future.

AB  - The purpose of the current study is to investigate the effects of the unplugged computational thinking (CT) integrated STEM (UCT-STEM) approach and STEM approach on early childhood pre-service teachers’ CT skills (creativity, algorithmic thinking, critical thinking, problem solving, cooperativity, communication). The study was conducted with a total of 70 early childhood pre-service teachers. Quasi-experimental design was used; activities based on the UCT-STEM approach were administered to the experimental group and activities based on the STEM approach were administered to the control group. Post-test scores for CT skills showed a statistically significant difference in favour of the experimental group. It was concluded that the UCT-STEM approach was more effective in developing the pre-service teachers’ CT skills than the STEM approach. The current study presents an important finding to the literature in terms of the developed STEM and UCT-STEM contents and how these contents improve pre-service teachers’ CT skills. The STEM and UCT-STEM content provides significant information in terms of teacher practices. At the same time, this study offers important implications for program developers and policy-makers to integrate these innovative educational approaches into both early childhood education and teacher education programs.

AB  - The integration of computational thinking (CT) to enhance creativity in design students has often been underexplored in design education. While design thinking has traditionally been the cornerstone of university design pedagogy and remains essential, the increasing role of digital tools and artificial intelligence in modern design practices presents new opportunities for innovation. By introducing CT alongside design thinking, students can expand their creative toolkit and engage with emerging technologies more effectively. Although many design students may have limited experience with programming, incorporating accessible, no-code tools can help them confidently embrace computational methods, unlocking new pathways for creative exploration and innovation. This study proposes an alternative approach to improve the motivation of design students by introducing machine learning tools into product design processes. We developed an experimental pedagogy in which 56 industrial design university students learned how to use Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (Weka), a machine learning tool, for three hours of design work a week, for a total of eight weeks. Our covariate analysis of data collected in the pretest and posttest shows that the general learning motivations in the group using Weka are significantly higher than those in the group without Weka. However, no significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of learning strategies, collaboration, or critical thinking. Students using Weka spent more time focusing on model training and tended to improve their algorithmic thinking, and the introduction of Weka appeared to enhance their motivation to learn. On the other hand, these students might have been focusing on working individually at their computers, potentially neglecting communication and collaboration. The findings suggest that teaching machine learning applications without requiring coding has the potential to boost design students' motivation to engage with CT skills, though care must be taken to maintain collaborative practices.

AB  - There is increasing effort to integrate Computational Thinking (CT) curricula across all education levels. Therefore, research on CT assessment has lately progressed towards developing and validating reliable CT assessment tools, which are crucial for evaluating students' potential learning progress and thus the effectiveness of suggested curricular programs. Several CT assessment tools were developed for elementary, high-school, and university students over the last years. Moreover, associations between CT scores and other cognitive abilities were unraveled. However, studies on the topic in primary school level are scarce. Like the general concept of intelligence, CT remains broadly defined as the ability to combine algorithmic operations to form complex solutions in order to solve problems effectively, utilizing concepts of computer science with or without the use of computers. In this study, we aimed at specifying a cognitive definition of CT, focusing on the under-investigated population of primary school children. Since validated assessment tools for this age group were not available, we adapted a validated CT test, which was initially designed for middle school students. In our study participated 192 third and fourth graders. The analyses revealed promising results on the reliability of the adapted CT assessment for primary school students. Moreover, findings indicated CT's positive associations with i. complex numerical abilities, ii. verbal reasoning abilities, and iii. non-verbal visuospatial abilities. Our results indicate similarities but also differences in associations of CT with other cognitive abilities in primary school children compared to other age groups. In summary: i. numerical abilities seem to associate with CT at the primary school level, whereas this seems not the case later on in education, ii. verbal abilities seem to associate with CT both along primary and secondary education levels, and iii. non-verbal reasoning abilities seem to associate with CT from primary education level to the university level and beyond. These differences imply that several basic cognitive abilities support CT abilities and CT development differentially across ages.

AB  - The concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI), born as the possibility of simulating the human brain's learning capabilities, quickly evolves into one of the educational technology concepts that provide tools for students to better themselves in a plethora of areas. Unlike the previous educational technology iterations, which are limited to instrumental use for providing platforms to build learning applications, AI has proposed a unique education laboratory by enabling students to explore an instrument that functions as a dynamic system of computational concepts. However, the extent of the implications of AI adaptation in modern education is yet to be explored. Motivated to fill the literature gap and to consider the emerging significance of AI in education, this paper aims to analyze the possible intertwined relationship between students’ intrinsic motivation for learning Artificial Intelligence during the COVID-19 pandemic; the relationship between students’ computational thinking and understanding of AI concepts; and the underlying dynamic relation, if existing, between AI and computational thinking building efforts. To investigate the mentioned relationships, the present empirical study employs mediation analysis based upon collected 137 survey data from Universidad Politécnica de Madrid students in the Institute for Educational Science and the School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering during the first quarter of 2022. Findings show that intrinsic motivation mediates the relationship between perceived Artificial Intelligence learning and computational thinking. Also, the research indicates that intrinsic motivation has a significant relationship with computational thinking and perceived Artificial Intelligence learning.

AB  - Computational thinking is widely recognized as an essential skill for adapting to the current era, with programming learning being the most effective means to develop it. It is recommended that computational thinking and learning programming be introduced as early as elementary school. However, elementary school students often possess limited prior knowledge of programming, posing challenges in their learning process. The graphic organizers (GOs) may serve as a bridge between students’ existing knowledge and new learning, facilitating a deeper processing of the overall information and thereby enhancing the learning process. This can be particularly advantageous for early-stage learners when grappling with difficult subjects. Consequently, this study employed GOs to assist elementary school students in their computational thinking and programming learning, employing a quasi-experiment design to evaluate their effectiveness. The results showed that although all students demonstrated awareness of applying computational thinking to solve problems, those exposed to GO-based instruction exhibited higher levels of computational thinking, programming skills, and flow experiences.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) practices is a critical cognitive tool for students to overcome challenges in this technological era. Few studies investigated CT practices from a development perspective. A two-year intervention was implemented in 30 intervention and 22 control schools in Hong Kong to promote CT education (T1baseline: N = 13,056; T2: N = 16,367; and T3: N = 15,269). Senior primary students (grades 4 to 6) around 8–12 years old were targeted. Among them, 34% were girls at T1baseline. Their learning progression of cognitive development was assessed with a CT practices test. Data were analyzed using item response analysis. Learning trajectories of CT practices were modeled to understand how students’ cognitive development differed between schools. Insights of findings were discussed in bringing CT practices to life.

AB  - Engagement is critical to computational thinking and programming education. However, as multi-dimensional variables, when analyzing how different aspects of engagement in computational thinking tasks influence skills development, it becomes crucial to discern precisely which engagement components intersect with the progression of computational thinking skills. This discernment is pivotal because engagement can vary based on the task nature, the context, and the individual's preferences. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the gender differences in engagement and computational thinking skills and the predictive relationships among these sub-dimensions for boys and girls in an unplugged environment. In this study, a quasi-experiment for 90 sixth-grade students from a north Chinese primary school was performed. By partial least squares–structural equation modeling, students’ models of computational thinking skills and engagement were analyzed, and comparisons of boys and girls were made by analysis of covariance statistics. Results indicated that compared with boys, girls reported higher computational thinking performance and more engagement in unplugged contexts. Furthermore, girls’ computational thinking skills were only predicted by their cognitive engagement, whereas boys’ computational thinking skills were predicted by their behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement. Teachers can adopt these findings to design computational thinking teaching interventions that combine the advantages of unplugged activity and focus on the engagement of boys and girls.

AB  - In this work, we argue for expanding the scope of K-12 computational thinking (CT) integration contexts to include everyday scenarios involving moral reasoning. Epistemic overlap between computational thinking practices and moral reasoning suggest that these contexts are potentially rich sites to see “seeds of CT” in children's reasoning and can provide rich educational pathways for children into CT. Taking a case-study approach, we examine the reasoning of a second-grader, Ollie, on a task involving fair allocation of resources to victims of a natural disaster. Our analysis finds that Ollie's reasoning was rich with seeds of CT (e.g., problem formulation, abstraction, complex-systems thinking) and that empathy served as an important supporting role to the CT. This work has implications for curricular design, suggesting that fairness and resource allocation scenarios with built-in opportunities for empathy might provide rich sandboxes for CT integration.

AB  - Although there are different definitions for computational thinking in the literature, it is possible to define it mainly as problem solving, designing and interpreting new systems by thinking like a computer. According to Wing (2006), computational thinking is a way of designing a system and understanding human behaviors by focusing on the basic concepts of the computer sciences. The recent focus on computational thinking as a key 21 st century skill for all students has led to a number of curriculum initiatives to embed it in K-12 classrooms and to introduce computing ideas to students early during their schooling years. The present study aims to explore the effects of a short, intensive coding and robotics training on the computational thinking skill self-efficacy of middle school students. 24 fifth graders participated in the study and data were collected by means of the Computational Thinking Self-efficacy scale (CTS) and one open-ended question. Analyses of the pre, post and delayed tests revealed significant differences between the pre and post-tests.

The benefits of utilizing the Design-Based Implementation Research (DBIR) approach in public libraries to resolve a persistent problem of practice, a lack of assessment tools to evaluate youth Computational Thinking (CT) programs, is demonstrated. Findings from a three-year, three-phased study utilizing the DBIR approach to design and implement a suite of assessment tools to assess CT programming in public libraries are presented. Guided by the four principles of the DBIR approach, this research produced new knowledge, including identifying CT program outcomes, challenges, and recommendations for designing and implementing assessment tools to measure the impact of public libraries' CT programming. Findings underscore the DBIR approach as a strategy for engaging with practitioners and helping shift their perspectives by resolving practice problems and facilitating the design of sustainable solutions.

AB  - Although there is controversy surrounding rewards and competition in education, they are key elements in digital game-based learning (DGBL). Research on the influence of rewards and competition in DGBL often yields mixed results, suggesting a need to investigate individual game elements and their interactions. This study implemented DGBL focusing on computational thinking (CT) in 7th-grade classes. Both quantitative and behavioral data were collected to understand the impact of rewards (power-up or customization) and competition (with or without) on students’ intrinsic motivation, game performance, behaviors, and CT skills. The findings uncovered significant interactions between rewards and competition. Students with both competition and power-up rewards achieved the highest game points but the lowest CT performance, whereas those exposed to the same power-up rewards without competition attained the lowest game points but the best CT performance. Implications are drawn for DGBL research and practice.

AB  - Despite growing interest in early childhood computational thinking (CT), there is a lack of validated assessments for children who are emerging readers. This paper presents validity and reliability evidence of a performance-based assessment of CT using item response theory (IRT) from 272 children aged 4–8. Using a two-parameter logistic model IRT model (2PL IRT), we confirmed that model- and item-level fits are acceptable. Item analyses revealed a high discriminability (M = 2.26, SD = 1.12) and a moderate item difficulty (M = −0.21; SD = 0.86), on average, across 19 items. Reliability analysis demonstrated that the assessment was substantially reliable (marginal reliability: rxx = 0.87). Differential item functioning (DIF) analyses indicated that the assessment estimated children's item parameters fairly, regardless of their gender and age. However, we confirmed gaps in latent ability (θ) of CT by gender and age: boys showed higher latent ability of CT than girls, and old children (above 72 months) showed higher latent ability than young children (below 72 months). Findings suggest the assessment is a fair measure that can serve as a reliable and valid tool to assess CT for children who are emerging readers.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is an important and essential skill for human beings to master in the 21st century. Although CT has received wide attention since this concept was proposed, the current theoretical models have not well defined the complex relations between CT and other cognitive abilities for young children. To provide insight into this gap, the current study proposed a model in which we hypothesized that CT was significantly related to arithmetic fluency that is viewed as an important domain of mathematics. Additionally, arithmetic fluency was predicted to mediate the relations of CT to other cognitive abilities, including reasoning and creativity. This study tested such direct and indirect relations in children aged 5–6 years. Consistent with previous studies on older age groups, the results showed that CT and arithmetic fluency were significantly related to each other and both were significantly related to reasoning ability and creative thinking as well. Moreover, this study, for the first time, indicated that arithmetic fluency totally mediated the relation between CT and reasoning ability, suggesting that these concepts share conceptual commonalities, such as the cognitive processes related to mathematics or/and abstraction; in contrast, arithmetic fluency did not mediate the relation between CT and creative thinking, suggesting that gaining CT skill may exert direct positive effect on the development of creativity. Therefore, despite the root in computer science, CT is associated with many cognitive and learning abilities in other domains, supporting the importance of including CT into early school education.

AB  - There has been growing interest in assessing computational thinking (CT) across diverse learners beyond the traditional forms of tests and assignments. Learning games offer the potential for innovative, stealth assessments of students' implicit learning from gameplay behaviors. This paper reports on the measurement of implicit CT practices demonstrated by upper elementary- and middle-school students as they play the CT learning game Zoombinis. The process of using the gameplay log data to build valid automated detectors of students' implicit CT practices is discussed. Findings from this study provide implications for analyzing gameplay behaviors at scale, leading to the development of models for the assessment of implicit STEM learning.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is critical for Twenty-first century life. Ensuring equitable access to CT depends on preparing teachers to integrate CT into disciplinary curricula. We report on the design, evaluation, and outcomes of the Computational Thinking Unplugged for Science (CT-UP-S) professional development program for inservice science teachers. Our process-based approach to CT significantly improved teachers CT understanding and CT/science integration self-efficacy by systematically linking CT practices to scaffold the generation of unplugged algorithms. Additionally, we found that the process-based approach provided a framework for teachers' lesson planning and that teachers’ content knowledge moderated their ability to write CT-integrated science lessons.

AB  - Early evidence suggests that robot programming offers an important foundation for spatial reasoning and computational thinking; however, researchers have debated how to introduce young children to these skills. We explored how preschoolers develop understanding of spatial concepts and computational thinking as the children took turns navigating a path during guided play with a programmable robot. Our analysis of the data included a multimodal visualization of the exchanges between the teacher, children, and a programmable robotic device. The findings highlight the effects that arose from the physical-digital convergence of technology integrated into play including: (a) the robot evoked a chain of actions, enacting pedagogic forces that transformed children's learning; (b) children used their own bodies as spatial referents, co-locating themselves in space with the robot; (c) the teacher remained a key actor, providing verbal and nonverbal scaffolding to promote children's understanding and mastery of spatial and computational concepts; and (d) talking with the teacher about spatial concepts combined with the interactions with the robot enhanced children's acquisition of spatial ideas relative to the quantity of children's verbal expressions and complexity of their applied spatial skills and computational thinking.

AB  - Workers in the areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics play a significant role in the sustained growth and stability of the global economy, and, thus constitute a critical component in helping all countries worldwide to prosper. In this context, computational thinking constitutes an important skill to have as it enables workers to develop creative solutions to complex problems. Nonetheless, across all economies worldwide, there is a need to have more workers who are able to think through problems, challenges, and solutions in computational terms. It is thus of utmost importance to integrate the teaching of computational thinking in K-12 education in order to reduce the skills gap between education and the workplace. A pertinent and crucial question that arises is whether teachers have the knowledge and skills to teach students how to think computationally. Existing research shows that teacher education departments do not currently have the knowledge to promote computational thinking in their programs. The present study focuses on two aspects of computational thinking, such as, algorithmic thinking and debugging skills with the use of scaffolded programming scripts in an educational technology undergraduate course. The results show statistically significant learning gains in pre-service teachers’ algorithmic thinking and debugging skills in the context of robotic programming activities with LEGO WeDo. Limitations and future research directions are discussed.

AB  - Recent studies identify Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) as a key factor in enhancing cognitive development, particularly within Computational Thinking (CT) literature. However, research gaps remain in understanding how SRL and CT interact from a developmental perspective. Our study designed a program with tailored animations and worksheets to specifically foster students' learning and cognitive development. Using a mixed-methods approach, we administered surveys among 1235 students from 29 Hong Kong primary schools to investigate a dynamic learning system comprising SRL and CT in a large-scale CT program. Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 students to further probe insights. Quantitative findings revealed a mutually reinforcing relationship in the dynamic system, suggesting that higher SRL skills enhance cognitive CT abilities, and vice versa. Complementing these results, qualitative findings showed that integrating animations and worksheets into the CT program significantly boosted students' SRL and cognitive development. These findings have significant implications for educational practices and curriculum design. Schools should consider implementing SRL strategies, such as proactive goal setting and reflective evaluation, within their curricula to promote students’ cognitive development. Furthermore, strategic investments in educational technology, including collaborations with EdTech developers, are essential to create effective, pedagogically sound tools that enhance learning outcomes. These insights provide valuable guidance for creating a supportive SRL environment that fosters cognitive development in primary school education.

AB  - In recent years, there has been increasing interest in integrating Computational Thinking (CT) into elementary schools. However, few studies have focused on teachers’ perceptions. This study aims to examine teachers' perceptions to bridge the gap between theory and practice. The study analysed teachers’ perceptions of integrating CT into school subjects through the constructionist approach, using Scratch a leading programming platform inspired by Resnick's Lifelong Kindergarten Constructionist model. Over a school year, 31 teachers participated in a professional development program and applied this model in their classrooms. The teachers were interviewed to capture their perceptions of learning and teaching using a constructionist method. The findings revealed that teachers with creative arts experience fully embraced the model, while others partially adopted it. Teachers recognized the benefits of constructionist teaching in fostering creativity, motivation, and engagement among students. However, they struggled with balancing these benefits with school demands and constraints. Challenges included managing time effectively within constraints of school and ensuring curriculum alignment. Despite this, many teachers found that the constructionist approach positively impacted students' learning engagement and personal development. By addressing the identified challenges, teacher education designers, curriculum developers, and schools can develop practices for closing the gap between theory and practice.

AB  - Educational research on predicting learners’ computer programming performance has yielded practical implications that guide task designs in computer education. There have been attempts to investigate learners’ computer programming patterns using high-frequency and automated data collection. This approach can be considered as process-based analysis as opposed to outcome-based analysis (i.e., the use of test or exam scores). In this process-based approach to investigate learners’ computer programming process, we included two critical constructs in our research, self-regulated learning and computational thinking skills. We aimed to identify learners’ computer programming patterns in the context that novice students learn a computer programming language, Python, in an online coding environment. We examined the relationships between the learners’ coding patterns, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills. Initially, we adopted a traditional approach with the aggregate data of learners’ computer programming behaviors. We then utilized a computational analytics approach to learner performance, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills, with ever-changing computer programming patterns. In our initial approach, the indicators of aggregate computer programming data were not associated with learners' learning performance and computational thinking skills. In the computational analysis approach, many indicators revealed significant differences between the identified patterns regarding computational thinking skills and self-regulated learning. Recommendations about the use of programming log data analysis methods and future scaffolding for computer programming learners are addressed.

AB  - In the field of education, research has consistently emphasized mathematical creative thinking as a crucial component of 21st-century skills. Thus, this cross-sectional study examines the predictors of such thinking by specifically focusing on the roles of perceived creativity, creative self-efficacy, and computational thinking. The participants consisted of 896 secondary school students (52.9 % female; 47.1 % male) in Indonesia who were asked to complete a series of online questionnaires and tests. For analysis, structural equation modeling was employed, demonstrating satisfactory construct validity and instrument reliability. Based on the results, there was a positive association between computational thinking and mathematical creative thinking. In addition, perceived creativity had a positive impact on mathematical creative thinking, whereas creative self-efficacy showed a negative association. As for the empirical model, it revealed that computational thinking plays a mediating role, connecting perceived creativity and creative self-efficacy to mathematical creative thinking. The findings suggest that incorporating these skills and related variables into the mathematics curriculums in schools is essential for preparing students for success in the 21st century.

AB  - Previous studies have explored the relationship between computational thinking (CT) and creativity. However, a consensus has yet to be reached since both CT and creativity varied in ideation and assessment. To uncover the cognitive mechanism underlying the interplay between CT and creativity, we conduct a scoping review of 26 empirical studies published in 2006–2024. Our findings suggested that the effects of working memory varied in the interplay between CT and creativity due to differences in age range, neural network activation regions, and measurements. Intellectual abilities, including algorithmic fluency, reasoning ability, and coding ability, showed cognitive transfer effect on CT skills but not necessarily on creativity, suggesting that cognitive abilities embracing more intelligent elements may contribute to the functional connectivity in CT neural networks but only partly overlapped with creativity involved networks. Although executive functions (working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control) play a crucial role in both CT and creativity, their contributions to the CT-creativity interplay are still rarely studied. Future research should explore the CT-creativity relationship from the perspective of neuroscience.

Sixty-six papers were selected for this systematic review and analyzed for patterns in relation to the implementation of CS education in K-12 schools and its impact on the development of students’ CT skills. Although educational interventions have not always been successful in CS education, this review provides strong evidence that overall, CS education promotes the development of students’ CT in the K-12 setting while improving their creative and critical thinking skills. We recommend early access to CS education, various innovative instructional approaches to CS education and appropriate support and guidance for student learning.

AB  - Recently, the development of computational thinking (CT) skills has become widespread in the whole world. There is a consensus to develop students’ CT skills through unplugged and plugged-in programming. However, the choice of programming approaches taught in schools is arbitrary and few studies have compared the effectiveness differences between unplugged and plugged-in programming. This study aimed to explore the differences between unplugged and plugged-in programming in developing CT skills of students in Grades 1-2 students. It also explored the joint effects of students’ gender, programming experience, programming interest, and programming confidence with different programming approaches on CT skills. The quasi-experimental research approach was used to conduct 10 weeks of unplugged, plugged-in, and regular programming activities with 124 Grades 1-2 students. The results found that unplugged programming promoted CT skills more in the early primary grades than plugged-in programming. We found that boys and students with programming experience in unplugged group performed significantly better in CT skills than in plugged-in group. Moreover, the improvement of CT skills of students in unplugged group was positively correlated with the level of their programming interest and programming confidence. However, these were not observed in plugged-in group. The results of this study can provide precise guidance for teaching CT skills to early primary school students and provide references for CT education.

AB  - This paper presents an investigation that compares and analyzes the interactions of three groups of pre-and-primary school children with three different storytelling systems. We identify emerging patterns through which they engaged in what we refer to as narrative computational thinking. The latter describes broadened aspects of narrative literacy practices that are linked to computational thinking. By applying a multicase study approach and through various vignettes, we illustrate how children applied computational thinking to understand and influence the narrative possibilities offered by the different tools. Our results illustrate circumstances under which digital storytelling activities provide a favorable basis for narrative computational thinking, and that when computational thinking functions as a scaffold for story creation, it encourages a blend of creativity and computational thinking, providing a compelling approach to introducing emerging digital literacies to young children in a narrative context.

AB  - In this study, it is aimed to identify the computational thinking skills used by gifted and talented students in integrated STEM activities based on the EDP. The case study design, a qualitative research method, is employed in the study. The participants consist of gifted and talented students attending the Science and Arts Center. Integrated STEM activities based on the EDP were conducted over the course of ten weeks and among these activities, robotic and 3D modeling-based robot construction activities using Lego sets are addressed in the present study. The STEM activity booklet, researchers' fieldnotes, and teaching process video recordings were used as data collection tools in the study. Data that was collected was analyzed through content analysis. It was seen that gifted and talented students participating in integrated STEM activities based on the EDP make active use of critical thinking skills while providing explanations, making associations, questioning information, giving justifications, solving problems, thinking creatively, making generalizations, and attempting to convince others; as for the instances of defining problems, creating solutions, and evaluating the effectiveness of the solution, the students were observed to actively use their problem-solving skills. The detailed account provided by the study on the way robotic and 3D robot modeling activities improve the computational thinking skills of gifted and talented students contributes to the required educational support and to the existing body of literature.

AB  - In the artificial intelligence age, cultivating young children's computational thinking (CT) has sparked tremendous attention. Programmable robotics is a developmental-appropriate and screen-free means that provides young children with great opportunities to learn programming and develop CT. However, it is reported that young children might have difficulties learning abstract CT concepts. As a helpful pedagogical facilitator, metaphors can help turn abstract concepts into more concrete and clear concepts that learners are familiar with. Therefore, this research proposed a metaphor-based robot programming (MRP) approach and explored its impact on young children's CT and behavioral patterns. A total of 118 children aged 5–6 were recruited in this experiment with two conditions: the experimental group adopted the metaphor-based robot programming (MRP) approach while the control group used the conventional robot programming (CRP) approach. Results revealed that children who adopted the MRP approach outperformed children who adopted the CRP approach on CT. In addition, behavioral analysis indicated that the proposed MRP approach could facilitate children's superior learning performance and more positive learning behaviors, so as to help them achieve learning objectives. Accordingly, this study can provide insightful guidance and inspiration for future research on effective programming teaching and CT development for young children.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is a necessary skill for students. It is as important as the other essential skills such as reading, writing, and arithmetic. However, how to improve students’ CT in robotics is still to be explored. Hence, this study examined the effects of computer supported project-based learning (CSPBL) on students’ CT and learning engagement through comparing students’ CT and engagement in two courses instructed by the same instructor (one instructed with a traditional method, the other instructed with CSPBL). Participants were seventy-nine students from a university in China. Questionnaires, interviews, and project analysis were used to measure students’ CT and learning engagement. The comparative results of self-reports and final projects indicated that the CSPBL enhanced students’ CT. The simulation project training based on the SenseStudy learning platform in CSPBL helped students debug the programming code, optimize the algorithm design, and improve their algorithmic thinking, cooperation, and problem solving during the program error correction. The CSPBL also improved students’ engagement in learning, especially for those with more than one year of programming experience. It was found that the CSPBL was effective in terms of improving students’ CT and engagement in robotics learning. This study provides teachers with practical suggestions to conduct effective robotics instruction.

AB  - Malaysia has introduced computational thinking skills as part of a curriculum integration update to meet the global trends in 21st-century education, focusing on empowering digital literacy. Nevertheless, a preliminary investigation revealed an apparent lack of understanding of computational thinking skills in general among teachers. The study explores the feasibility of developing a localized E-learning system to train computational thinking skills among teachers. An E-learning system, termed as myCTGWBL, was developed on the basis of a newly proposed conceptual framework to present computational thinking teaching–learning repertoire to the teachers. The hypothesis is that myCTGWBL would develop teachers' computational thinking and its position in teaching–learning understanding. myCTGWBL relevance was tested through DeLone and McLean's information system and Urbach's collaboration quality construct. To determine the success factors, partial least squares structural equation modeling was used. A total of 369 teachers participated in a two-stage survey. Participants' understanding of computational thinking and perceptions were recorded at the pre- and post-intervention phases. Open-ended questions of the surveys were analyzed using a simple text analysis technique. The closed-ended questions surveys were analyzed using SPSS Statistics 22.0. A significant improvement in teachers' computational thinking teaching–learning repertoire in a relatively short period has been recorded. Teachers also demonstrated increased confidence in the future delivering computational thinking-based lessons. The E-learning conceptual framework has illustrated the predictive power between user intent, user satisfaction, and Computational thinking (CT) knowledge benefits. Results demonstrate that myCTGWBL could be used to guide future planning when establishing CT knowledge acquisition initiatives, particularly among teachers.

AB  - Efforts to incorporate computational thinking (CT) into academic courses have been gaining popularity. CT is a problem-solving skill that is crucial in the 21st century. CT may be used to support language education. Courses in English as a foreign language often need an effective writing component that includes writing organization and language use, as demonstrated by the poor writing samples often generated by students of these courses. To address the problems, CT, which is a higher-order mode of problem-solving and knowledge acquisition optimization, was used. The experimental group was instructed using the CT teaching model based on CT's essential components (decomposition, generalization, abstraction, algorithm, and evaluation), whereas the control group was taught using the conventional method. In total, 58 undergraduate students divided into two groups participated in this study. A combination of writing, CT skills, surveys, and interviews were used to collect data according to an experimental design. The collected quantitative data were analyzed through analysis of covariance and structural equation modeling, and the MAXQDA 2022software was used to analyze the collected qualitative data. The results of this study indicate that incorporating CT into an English writing course enhances the writing and higher-order thinking skills of students. The CT concepts helps students develop critical thinking skills by evaluating the text and identifying potential issues or improvements. Additionally, it allows students to use their skills to create unique writing solutions, which can boost English writing creativity.

AB  - Computational thinking education has become an increasingly popular topic among practitioners and researchers. However, rare is known how to effectively teach and learn computational thinking in early childhood education. To address this knowledge gap, this systematic review examined 26 studies on the teaching and learning of computational thinking in early childhood education from 2010 to 2022. The content knowledge, tools, pedagogical design, assessment methods, and learning outcomes were analyzed. Results indicated that, with age-appropriate instructional design, children could develop early concepts and skills of computational thinking, as well as other related skills such as communication, collaboration, and problem solving. Across the studies, we found that most studies used quantitative research methods, with direct assessment and observation being the most. Several challenges were identified: (1) achieving a deeper learning of computational thinking; (2) a lack of valid and reliable computational thinking assessments for children with a wider age range; (3) selecting appropriate learning tools; and (4) designing age-appropriate activities for young learners. Although with these challenges, computational thinking education could bring new learning opportunities and enhance children's computational thinking skills, as well as other non-cognitive skills such as critical thinking, body-material interaction, and hand-eye coordination. This systematic review informs future endeavors in theorizing a digital learning framework that can integrate computational thinking into early childhood education.

AB  - Teacher competencies encompass the dimensions of knowledge and attitudes, yet few studies have analysed teachers' latent profiles in relation to the interaction between these two dimensions. Latent profile analysis, which examines the interplay between variables to distinguish subgroups of individuals, has recently emerged in studies of computational thinking (CT) as a method for identifying student profiles. However, the latent profiles of CT teachers have not yet been analysed. We therefore analysed the latent profiles of a sample of 493 teachers who had participated in a teacher development programme in CT, according to their knowledge and perceived usefulness of CT. Three profiles were identified: (1) highly knowledgeable with high perceived usefulness, (2) knowledgeable with low perceived usefulness, and (3) less knowledgeable with low perceived usefulness. Qualitative data further triangulated these findings. We also examined the learning achievement of 12,105 students taught by these teachers. Students taught by highly knowledgeable teachers with a high perceived sense of usefulness demonstrated significantly better achievement than their peers. Our findings highlight the importance of nurturing both knowledge of and perceived usefulness in CT. They also provide valuable insights for similar teacher development programmes, emphasizing the importance of peer mentoring support for less knowledgeable teachers. Additionally, we underscore the value of having teachers create artefacts using CT for instructional purposes, allowing them to gain firsthand experience of its usefulness. As few studies have explored teachers' latent profiles based on the dimensions of knowledge and attitudes, the contribution of this study extends beyond the domain of CT.

AB  - We designed a controlled trial protocol that seeks to contribute to cognitive science by studying the effect of thought training on children's executive functions. The study design is a cluster randomized controlled trial, with intra-subject and inter-subject evaluation, with two parallel groups: an experimental group and a TAU control group. With three measures, pre-test, post-test, and follow-up after three months. The participants will be children aged 9 to 11. The allocation will be randomized by groups and not individually. The sample will be a minimum of 44 participants. The primary measures will be neuropsychological tests to assess executive functions. Secondary measures will be a computational thinking test, neuropsychological tests to assess metacognition and attention, and an acceptability scale. The experimental group will participate in the COGNI-MACHINE computational thinking training designed by the first author. The training frequency will be twice a week in 60 min sessions for 12 weeks. The TAU control group will receive computer science classes as usual during the same time as the experimental group. The evaluators taking the measurements will be blinded to the assignment. The investigators in charge of the intervention will be blinded to the results of the evaluations.

AB  - Negative feedback can temporarily relieve negative Chinese transfer (NCT) in English as a foreign language (EFL) syntactic writing by focusing only on the surface writing constructs, neglecting that EFL writing is an embodiment of the process by which higher-order thinking operates. To solve the problem, the researchers conducted a pretest, interventionist group dynamic assessment (IGDA) in the form of negative feedback based on computational thinking (CT), higher-order thinking, and post-test quasi-experimental design, with a control group receiving the direct correction feedback instructing model to mitigate the NCT in EFL syntactic writing. We analyzed the syntactic writing types and frequencies of the NCT obtained through repeated-measure ANOVA and confirmed by qualitative data through video recording. The results indicated that IGDA in the form of negative feedback based on CT principal skills could (1) significantly decrease syntactic writing errors caused by the NCT, (2) improve learners’ EFL writing performance, and finally, (3) elevate the computer as an essential mediation tool. This innovative instructing mode of intervening with writing constructs and higher-order thinking and bringing about deeper thinking and creativity contributes to the EFL writing teaching methodology in a foreign language higher education.

AB  - The tenure system in the United States places significant importance on teaching effectiveness. To date, students' evaluations of teaching (SETs) have been the reigning mechanism for assessing effective teaching. However, prior work has shown that SETs are often biased against underrepresented groups and minorities. The present study analyzes options for effective teaching assessments, which include evaluating final grades and measuring the differences between students’ pre- and post-tests (normalized gain) using standard instruments. The content area and the instrument used in this study originated in the computational thinking field, which has a widespread presence in engineering, where minorities are at a disadvantage. This study obtained a total of 88 student participants from four sections of an introductory engineering course at a Southwestern institution. The study utilized a computational thinking diagnostic (CTD) to inform the course teaching approach (the intervention). Results show that (a) normalized learning gains correlated moderately with SETs, (b) final grades correlated strongly with SETs, (c) final grades correlated strongly with normalized learning gains, (d) the educational intervention based on the CTD significantly affected student learning, and (e) SET comments affect evaluations. The implications include the notion that standardized instrument-driven instruction and evaluations can increase the success of minorities on both sides of the classroom. The purpose of this manuscript is to invite the Heliyon readership to get involved in the development of related instruments and to incorporate these measures of learning into their instruction so biases are avoided or minimized.

AB  - In the digital age, our lives become more dependent on technology, yet the digital gap is intensifying especially because most people lack digital literacy. As a modest step to handle this challenge, we designed a course named "Play with me in Code" to develop pre-service teachers' (PSTs) thinking skills and expose them to learning by creation using computational thinking and programming as part of the constructionism paradigm. The added value of using Scratch in the context of teacher education lies not only in familiarity with a programming language but with an emphasis on experiencing self-directed learning tackling with problem solving situations, creativity, socioemotional competencies, and logical computational thinking. The present study aims to examine 25 PSTs' attitudes towards facing challenges of coding with Scratch. To this end, a mixed-method approach was activated by using questionnaires, blog posts, and reflections. Findings revealed that the learning environment encouraged PSTs' use of abstraction and decomposition to address a complex problem or to design a complex game. Study's conclusions relate to the importance of providing PSTs opportunities to experience learning by programming for raising their awareness of the importance of enhancing thinking skills and creativity in the future.

AB  - Using the analytical tool CiteSpace, this review study conducted a bibliometric analysis of the characteristics of 249 studies on Computational Thinking (CT) indexed in the Web of Science from 2012 to 2021. The multi-dimensional analytical approach provided a holistic view of the scope of CT research and its progression,and enabled the major topics, themes, disciplinary domains, and prominent authors, institutes, countries/regions, and papers to be identified. Based on the general descriptive data analysis, the results showed that CT has gained increasing influence as a field of research over the past decade. A clustering analysis of the retrieved keywords showed that the development of CT in K-12 education was the most frequently discussed topic. The co-occurrence knowledge maps identified the 11 main research themes and their progress. The research was from a wide spectrum of disciplines including education, science education, computer science, interdisciplinary application, psychology, engineering, and information systems. The highest co-citations were found in the journals of Communication of the ACM, Computers and Education, and Computers in Human Behaviors. The researchers, institutes, and countries/regions that have made the most significant contributions to CT research and the 10 most highly cited CT studies were also identified. Overall, the findings of this review study indicate the paths for future research on developing CT in the classroom.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT), a way to think about solving problems, is recognized as a basic skill for the 21st century. Although game-based learning (GBL) has been shown to improve student's CT skills, students may fail to self-evaluate or debate as they play games, thus failing to develop higher-order thinking. Also not widely explored is how teachers are to practice the CT core competencies during the learning process to cultivate students' problem-solving thinking. As the adoption of student-generated questions (SGQ) is an instructional strategy to promote higher-order thinking, we develop a GBL platform that uses this strategy to enhance students' CT skills, learning motivation, and learning confidence. For this purpose, fifty-three primary school students were recruited for this study, and data were collected during four classes of experimental CT activities. This study shows that the experimental group using the SGQ strategy with a GBL platform exhibited significantly higher CT skills than the control group. In addition, with respect to learning motivation and learning confidence it is found that the experimental group also outperformed the control group. This confirms that integrating the SGQ strategy and CT core competencies fosters higher-order cognitive thinking in students in problem-solving through gamification of the learning environment, resulting in higher motivation and confidence to complete experimental activities.

AB  - To effectively utilize artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies such as ChatGPT and realize their novel ethical issues, individuals must have a variety of knowledge and skills about AI. Such knowledge and skills have led to the emergence of AI literacy. Despite the importance of AI literacy in everyday life, little is known about its determinants. To better understand the determinants of AI literacy, we attempted to build a research model relying on previous research and different theoretical frameworks. The model incorporated digital divide, cognitive absorption, and computational thinking. As a major finding from the current study, computational thinking was found to be a significant determinant of AI literacy, which facilitate using, recognizing, and evaluating AI-based technologies. Moreover, we found out that individuals with physical access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) are more expected to use and recognize AI. Also, motivation and skills in using ICTs enable individuals to better evaluate the outcomes of AI-based technologies. The findings also showed that convenient access to ICTs contributes to a deep involvement with AI-based technologies in the use. Further, individuals with higher motivation and skills to use AI technologies are likely to have a pleasant experience after using these technologies.

AB  - Both computational thinking (CT) and creativity have been recognized as key skills for today's learners. Over the last decade, research of both skills in a single context has emerged. In this paper, we present a scoping review of 62 such empirical from 2011 to 2020. Our goal was to have a thorough understanding of the educational settings in which research on both CT and creativity was conducted, the theoretical foundations it has laid down, and the research tools used. Our findings indicate a geographical bias (dominance of the US and prominence of developed European countries), as well as a focus on secondary education and on STEM-related disciplines; this could be explained by the current situation of CT spread. We also found that when studying CT and creativity jointly, it is most common to define CT in a broader perspective than merely programming of computer science. Additionally, while creativity is largely referred to as product-related, CT is barely referred to as such. Taken together, our findings point out some gaps in the current research of CT and creativity and suggest how it should be expended on the fertile grounds of creativity, as the latter crosses geographical, age, and subject borders. Doing so may build a bridge between CT and creativity in a way that will benefit both.

AB  - This paper sheds light on 3–5-year-old children’s enactments of computational empowerment (CE) in activities with computational thinking (CT). CT is widely elaborated on as a universal problem-solving approach and a skill set necessary for thriving in today’s digitized societies. Scholars claim that CT for all should be ensured from an early age, and several studies develop and examine age-appropriate technological tools, as well as pedagogical approaches, for young children’s learning of CT. Based on 1.5 years of co-designing for children’s situated CT in two Danish kindergartens, the present study conducts a socioculturally informed analysis of video-observed interactions between children and educational robots. The findings display how children and robots engage in interactions that transcend children’s mastery of CT in any narrow sense. This is examined as situated enactments of CE; as children’s critical and informed decisions regarding the roles that technologies, in this case educational robots, can play in their institutionally situated social lives. The paper concludes that children’s various enactments of CE deserve scholarly and professional attention, both as an important prerequisite for, and as a necessary limitation to, the implementation of CT in kindergartens.

AB  - Since the end of the 20th century, the digitalization of society, including the educational systems, has been growing exponentially. At the same time, education systems have been evolving towards competency-based assessment. Likewise, at the beginning of this century, the idea of Computational Thinking was resurrected by J. Wing, for solving problems and designing systems using concepts of computer science. Today, we can see how all these questions are taking shape in a new competence, called Computational Thinking, related to others that already exist. In this paper, we have studied the skills of Computational Thinking in university students, focusing on abstraction and its possible relationship with other factors. Results conclude that the students fail in relation to abstraction and in algorithmic thinking. Although the ability of abstraction is not easy to measure, a linear regression analysis has been carried out in order to determine its possible study.

AB  - Teaching computational thinking (CT) has become a priority for educators and policymakers tasked with educating and training students for future jobs which are predicted to be increasingly automated. Recent research on effective instructional interventions for developing computational thinking skills, including algorithmic and critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity, and cooperativity, suggests that teaching and learning CT can improve student academic performance. In fact, the extant literature is quite sanguine about the topic of CT. However, few studies have attempted to establish a relationship between CT skills and academic performance. In the present cross-sectional study, we employ path analysis to model the structural relationship between self-reported CT skills and academic performance of a sample of 81 computer science undergraduates enrolled at a Southwestern American university. We found few direct relationships between CT skills and academic performance. We only find a significant positive relationship between creativity and academic performance and a significant negative relationship between cooperativity and academic performance. Our findings are surprising considering the abundant research promoting computational thinking as a key component of 21st century skills. The findings call for further in-depth analysis of computational thinking and the influence on students’ learning and learning outcomes. We discuss our results with respect to recent educational mandates for including CT and instructional alignment in school curricula. Our findings contribute to the existing discussion by helping to clarify the relationship between CT skills and academic performance in higher education.

AB  - Although studies have shown that computational thinking (CT) can enhance learning processes and outcomes across traditional subjects, they have not shown how teachers might scaffold children's CT processes in a technology-mediated learning context. This exploratory study examined how teacher talk and technologies impacted the CT of three children (6 to 8 years old). Seven videotaped 90-minute sessions of weekly project-based activities yielded 4,842 turns of talk (2,974 by children). Statistical discourse analysis revealed the following results. After a teacher command, the children more often executed a sequence of actions toward a solution but less often demonstrated problem understanding than otherwise. Following a teacher's open question, the children were more likely to offer logically organized ideas. In response to a teacher's rhetorical question, they more often searched for information. These results inform educators regarding when to use each type of teacher talk to scaffold children's CT processes.

AB  - ChatGPT (generative pre-trained transformer) is one of the artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that have started to be used in programming education. However, the effect of using ChatGPT in programming education on learning processes and outcomes is not yet known. This study investigated the effect of programming education using the ChatGPT on students' computational thinking skills, programming self-efficacy, and motivation toward the lesson. The research was conducted on 45 undergraduate students who took a university-level programming course. The research was carried out according to the experimental design with the pretest-posttest control group. Students were randomly divided into experimental (n = 21) and control (n = 24) groups. While the experimental group students benefited from the ChatGPT during the weekly programming practices, the control group students did not use this tool. Research data were obtained through the computational thinking scale, computer programming self-efficacy scale, and learning motivation in computer programming courses scale. Research findings revealed that the experimental group students' computational thinking skills, programming self-efficacy, and motivation for the lesson were significantly higher than the control group students. In line with this result, it can be said that it may be useful to benefit from AI technologies such as ChatGPT in programming trainings. The research findings, it was emphasized how the most effective use of AI support in the lessons could be made, and various suggestions were made for researchers and educators in this regard.

AB  - In this paper, we explore how the theoretical notion of possibility space offers a way to study how children's computational thinking develops as a process. Drawing on embodied notions of cognition, we first examine the literature that supports how children's computational thinking emerges as a possibility space that involves conceptualizing possible actions in a given moment, deciding which action to take by anticipating the results of a possible action, and learning from the actions that they have taken. We then use a grounded approach to analyze the problem-solving process of two 5th-grade children who engaged in an educational robotics activity over two 50-minute class periods. The findings lend support for approaching children's computational thinking as a cycle of action-taking that includes conceptualizing, anticipating, and taking action. The findings also support the pedagogical practice of having children predict the results of a computer program to enhance their computational thinking. Implications for the way that teachers can support children in learning to conceptualize what is possible and take action from it are discussed.

AB  - Predictive learner modelling is crucial for personalized education. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great success in education, their potential in learner modelling via image data is unexplored. This research introduces a novel and interpretable approach for Image-based Learner Modelling (ImageLM) using CNNs and transfer learning to model learners’ performance and accordingly classify their computational thinking solutions. The approach integrates Grad-CAM, enabling it to provide insights into its decision-making process. Findings show that our custom CNN outperforms other models (namely ResNet, VGG, and Inception), with 83% accuracy in predicting solution correctness. More importantly, the ImageLM approach identifies the regions that contribute the most to the predictions, shedding light on learners' computational thinking knowledge and advancing toward trustworthy AI for education. These results underline the potential of utilizing imagery data from learners’ activities during the learning process to predict their performance, especially in challenging environments like programming where traditional feature extraction and learning might struggle.

AB  - The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has led to the proliferation of computational thinking (CT) education. However, research on unplugged activities’ influence in elementary math classrooms is limited, despite some exploring programming's cognitive benefits. This study presents both qualitative and quantitative analyzes stemming from a ten-week quasi-experimental research endeavor, specifically tailored for third-grade students. The research devised a series of unplugged activities, encompassing mathematical games, hands-on construction of mathematical logic boards, and calculating shopping discounts. The overarching objective was to investigate the impact of these unplugged activities on students’ mathematical creativity and CT. Students participating in a mathematics curriculum based on unplugged activities (N = 47) were compared with students participating in a traditional lecture-based mathematics curriculum (N = 46). The results indicated that unplugged activities exhibited significant advantages in fostering students’ CT and mathematical creativity across three dimensions, namely, problem-posing creativity (t = 5.830, p < 0.01), problem-solving creativity (t = 6.633, p < 0.01), and creative self-efficacy (t = 7.554, p < 0.01). Furthermore, the study revealed a relationship between students’ mathematical creativity as a predictor of CT. The results of the quantitative analysis were supported by the teacher's and students’ interview data, and the students felt excited and interested in the unplugged activities, whereas some students using the lecture-based method reported boredom and lack of interactivity. This research offered valuable insights for mathematics and CT education practice, underscoring unplugged activity as an innovative instructional approach that brings forth new possibilities for traditional mathematics teaching, with potential applications in the K-12 curriculum.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has received worldwide attention due to its alignment with developing 21st century skills such as creativity, problem-solving, and digital competence. With the increasing provision of programming tools such as robotic toys and tablet apps in the sector of early childhood education (ECE), many ECE researchers and practitioners tend to link CT to programming. However, children are reluctant to sustain their interests in programming activities, and may be further demotivated by debugging failures. This multi-group quasi-experimental study aimed to evaluate the effects of a story-inspired approach in bridging the gap between programming and CT for preschool children. Building on previous literature suggesting storytelling as a powerful, culturally responsive pedagogy, 5-year-old children (N=108) were involved in nine weeks of CT learning via one of the three conditions: Story-Inspired Robot Programming (SIRP), Story-Inspired Tablet Programming (SITP), and unplugged CT education. Results revealed that children who participated in the SIRP and SITP conditions showed improved CT scores, relative to unplugged CT education, even after controlling for baseline CT scores. No gender or family socioeconomic effects were found to influence the benefits of story-inspired programming interventions. These findings suggest that storytelling as a culturally responsive approach, whether using robots or tablets as a programming tool, can provide young children with more inclusive and sustainable CT learning experiences.

AB  - Content area K-12 teachers are increasingly asked to integrate computing and computational thinking into their classrooms, yet they often have little experience with computing. The purpose of this study was to understand how science teachers, new to computing and integrating computational thinking into their classrooms, supported students as computational problem solvers. In the project from which this research was drawn, 8th grade science teachers in three US school districts integrated computer game design into their study of climate systems and climate change. We conducted participant observation, collected teacher implementation logs and interviewed 15 teachers engaged in the three-year design research project, Building Systems from Scratch. Analysis through grounded theory yielded several results related to teachers’ orientations, strategies, and use of resources to create systems of distributed expertise. We identified five major themes: a) releasing responsibility to students, b) co-learning with students, c) encouraging students’ independent problem solving, d) building interdependence among students, and e) providing multiple other resources. Findings are discussed in relation to the literature on integrating computational thinking into content area classrooms.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is currently used as an umbrella term in education to describe the processes associated with learning and applying computer science concepts and strategies for problem-solving. Despite a growing body of literature on the subject within education and the development of a grand variety of tools designed to enhance computational thinking abilities, the relations between CT and other cognitive abilities have not been reported in young children. Understanding CT from a cognitive development perspective could be useful for creating targeted interventions tailored for young children. In the present study, we compare a previously reported computational thinking assessment with a battery of nine cognitive tests, which include fluid intelligence, working memory, planning, sequencing, mental rotation, vocabulary, and early math precursors such as numerical transcoding and symbolic magnitude comparison. Mixed-effects linear regressions were implemented with CT as a dependent variable to explore the associations between our variables. A subsample of children who participated in an educational robotics intervention were assessed in their robot programming performance, and its outcomes were compared with their CT assessments. Results suggest temporal sequencing ability and symbolic magnitude comparison are significant predictors of CT in kindergarten. Positive significant associations between robot programming and CT performance are reported.

AB  - The research aims to evaluate the effect of a robotics-based computational thinking program on executive functions and visuospatial skills in preschool children. Additionally, the study will explore the relationship between these three variables and early experiences with toys. The study will be a cluster-randomized controlled trial with pre- and post-intervention measures. Participants will be preschool children aged 5 to 6 years from both public and private institutions. The intervention will involve a new educational robotics device called ROVERSA and will consist of eight sessions distributed over four weeks, with the experimental group placed on a waitlist. To assess executive functions and visuospatial skills, standardized and validated neuropsychological measures will be used, including the Flanker task, the NIH Toolbox Card Sorting Test, the Corsi Block Test, the NEPSY-II Mental Rotation Test, the Pyramid of Mexico from the ENI-2 battery, and the Computational Thinking Test (CTt). Data analysis will begin with a hypothesis tested through ANOVA-MR, and linear regressions will be implemented to assess the relationship between variables. It is expected that the results will contribute to the discussion on teaching computational thinking and educational robotics as early learning experiences and their impact on the cognitive development of children.

AB  - This study examined the impact of a 10-month STEM professional development (PD) program on 25 teachers working with gifted students. The program aimed to enhance pedagogical knowledge and competencies. Findings indicated significant positive improvements in teachers' STEM self-efficacy, computational thinking, and entrepreneurship skills. The PD program also had a direct positive influence on the quality of lesson plans. The study suggests that effective PD design should incorporate scientific inquiry, engineering design processes, computational thinking, entrepreneurship skills, and the development of teachers' self-efficacy for successful implementation of PD outcomes in STEM education.

AB  - Educators emphasize that computational thinking is especially helpful in raising problem-solving skills, improving logical reasoning, and developing analytical thinking. In this context, the aim of this study is to develop an online, interactive, valid, reliable and useful performance-based assessment tool for measuring computational thinking skills. Data were collected in two stages with three different measurement tools. In the data collection phase, a psychometric scale, a skill test and an interactive web application developed in this study were used. In the study in which a total of 203 high school students participated, it was determined that the students' computational thinking skills were at average level. as a result, a valid and reliable performance-based platform was developed for measuring computational thinking skills. It has also been concluded that the performance-based measurement tool makes a better measurement than the psychometric scale. It is emphasized that computational thinking should be treated as a skill or group of skills, not as a theoretical knowledge, product/portfolio or attitude/perception. Therefore, it is believed that developing performance-based tools for evaluating computational thinking skills and measuring them by using multiple measurement tools will give more accurate results. Considering the developments in computational thinking, it is thought that the study will contribute to the literature.

AB  - Computing education has progressively entered into children's early years. Due to a proliferation of computing education programs and coding tools designed for young children, research on the relationships between computational thinking (CT) and other domains of learning and development is highly warranted. Yet, there is little empirical evidence that shows the relationship between CT and children's overall cognitive functioning. As such, this study explored the relationships between Chinese children's CT and their sequencing ability and self-regulation in early childhood. One hundred and one Chinese young children (Ngirl = 52 and Nboy = 49; Mage = 5.25, SD = 0.73) were recruited and evaluated with three reliable instruments. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that: (1) CT positively predicted sequencing ability (β = 0.27, p < .05) even after controlling for relevant demographic covariates such as age, gender, and family socioeconomic status; (2) CT positively predicted self-regulation (β = 0.47, p < .001) after controlling for demographic covariates. Our findings suggest that CT may be a domain-general ability that is based on cognitive foundations that extend beyond the realm of computing.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is regarded as the conceptual basis required for identifying and solving real-world problems through algorithmic approaches to achieve transferable solutions. Developing students' CT in primary school stages is essential and has received considerable attention. Meanwhile, researchers incorporated digital badges into classrooms to improve students' learning motivation in computer science (CS). However, few solid empirical studies analyze the effects of the digital badges approach in CS education to develop students' CT. Therefore, to bridge this gap, this study designed and implemented a block-based programming course in a primary school and examined the impact of the digital badges approach on pupils' CT skills and self-efficacy and learning motivation in CS. A quasi-experimental design was conducted among 99 third-grade students across three classes. The results revealed that the adapted digital badges in primary school (1) significantly improved the students' CT skills, (2) had no significant positive impact on their CT self-efficacy or learning motivation in CS, and (3) showed no mediating effect of learning motivation on the relationship between CT skills and CT self-efficacy. In addition, we found that whether students could see only their own digital badges or also those of others had no impact on CT skills, self-efficacy, or learning motivation in CS. These findings have implications for the design of digital badge educational interventions intended to promote students' CT and learning motivation.

AB  - Computational thinking refers to a series of cognitive processes involved in solving problems through computational systems. A growing body of studies has managed to demonstrate the correlation between computational thinking and different cognitive domains. In recent decades, multiple studies have taken place that seek to evaluate the effect of computational thinking on higher-order cognitive processes. The current study aims to contribute to this discussion by analyzing the effect of an intervention program in computational thinking on the executive functions of school-age children. In this experimental study, 30 children aged 10 and 11 were randomly assigned to an experimental group and an active control group. The instruments to collect the data were 15 tests of the neuropsychological battery of executive functions and frontal lobes BANFE-2, which were applied to both groups before and after the intervention. The experimental group participated in an 8-week computational thinking intervention during which its participants enrolled in plugged and unplugged activities and carried out block programming language twice a week. The results showed that the intervention had significant effects on executive functions associated with the anterior prefrontal cortex and the dorsolateral cortex, but not those related to the orbitofrontal area.

AB  - Learning coding during early childhood is an effective way for children to practice computational thinking. Aspects of children's motivation can increase the likelihood that children approach computational thinking activities with enthusiasm and deep engagement. Gender inequities may interfere with children's readiness to take advantage of opportunities to build computational thinking skills through activities such as coding. Societal stereotypes can reduce young girls’ motivation to engage with computer science, preventing them from gaining benefits from coding activities designed to support computational thinking. This study examined children's gender stereotypes as well as children's own motivation for computer coding in 363 first- through third-grade children. We assessed gender differences in both stereotypes and motivation, as well as links between the stereotypes that individual children held and their own motivation. Children generally endorsed stereotypes about interest and ability for computer coding that favored their own-gender group, although third-grade girls reported gender-egalitarian beliefs about interest in coding. There were no gender differences in children's motivation for computer coding in terms of their own interest, sense of belonging, or ability self-concepts. Children's stereotypes about their own-gender group were significantly positively correlated with their own motivation for computer coding. These findings suggest that early childhood represents an excellent age for children to begin building computational thinking skills, before girls endorse negative stereotypes about their gender's interest in computer science.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is an essential skill students need if they are to adapt to the rise of digital society, and the evaluation of CT is crucial for enhancing students’ CT. However, the current evaluation of CT is based on a summative paradigm and ignores real CT performance during the assessment process. This study thus used a multimodal cognitive diagnostic model (H-MCDM) of students’ CT based on multimodal data in situational tasks, to achieve precise evaluation and explore the current mastery status of students’ CT and their cognitive and behavioral characteristics. The research results indicate that: 1) students’ CT was at a moderately high level and indicated a good grasp of the CT components of problem decomposition and algorithm design, but students had not yet mastered problem abstraction, 2) a total of six different CT latent patterns were discerned in the overall student results, 3) individual students who shared the same CT latent patterns could differ in their cognitive and behavioral characteristics, while those with different CT latent patterns could share similar characteristics. This study showed that it is possible to capture the degree of students’ mastery of CT and their cognitive and behavioral differences with the same or different CT latent patterns at a granular level, providing a basis for developing individualized strategies to enhance students’ CT.

AB  - In-service elementary school teachers need training to teach computational thinking (CT). A common model for CT professional learning programs includes an initial workshop followed by ongoing support. However, little research has examined the efficacy of ongoing support, the most effective types, and its impact on classroom practices. The current study details a multifaceted CT professional learning program with innovative ongoing support to help elementary school teachers implement the Code.org curriculum. It also empirically investigated the impact of the support on teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT, the effectiveness of each component of the support, and to what extent it affected teachers' classroom practices. Our ongoing support included an additional workshop, grade-level professional learning community (PLC) sessions, instructional videos, and teacher leaders' support. Data included a pre-survey, four post-surveys, lesson observations, a focus group interview, tracking the number of video views, and surveys from PLC participants and teacher leaders. Results indicated that the ongoing support significantly increased teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT. Regarding the effectiveness of the various components of the ongoing support, the additional workshop significantly increased teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT. Teachers valued each component of the support, and this support improved teachers’ classroom practices.

AB  - The present study investigates the debugging process of 526 children in preschool (4–6 aged) when programming a tangible robot. When a child is involved in programming, it is needed to identify and correct errors, or in other words, debug a program. Debugging is a high-level thinking skill and is an essential component closely related to developing Computational Thinking in early childhood education. Though the debugging process is a cognitive function in programming investigated by many researchers in recent decades, most studies are conducted either in primary, secondary education, or higher education concerning beginners or experts in programming. Very few reviews, and some focus on preschool education. Our study set out the following objectives: 1) How do children identify the existence of error and locate it? 2) What types of errors emerge when coding? 3) What type of error is complex for novice programmers? 4) What strategies are developed by novice programmers to debug effectively? and 5) What types of knowledge do novice programmers construct by debugging the tangible robot Bee-Bot? The study follows an iterative model of a design-based research approach. It uses multiple case studies to collect qualitative and quantitative data. The programming intervention was implemented by 30 educators in their classrooms and was based on a scenario-based teaching design. The debugging process was analysed using Klahr & Craven's framework (1988): 1) test and evaluate program, 2) identify bug, 3) represent program, 4) locate bug and 5) correct bug. The main finding is the construction and development of syntactic and semantic knowledge.

AB  - A plethora of programming platforms purports to teach preschool-aged children computational thinking (CT) and coding skills. However, the empirical evidence to support their effectiveness is still in its early stages. A three-week didactic intervention using ScratchJr was conducted to investigate its effectiveness in fostering CT and rudimentary coding skills in a cohort of preschool children (N = 34, aged 4–6 years). While the initial performance mean of the control group (M = 7.07, SD = 2.58) exhibits a statistically significant elevation t (22.64 = 2.23, p = 0.036) vis-à-vis the experimental group (M = 5.35, SD = 1.58), t (22.64) = 2.23, p = 0.0 the terminal performance means of both groups converge closely. However, meticulous data analysis unveils a statistically notable enhancement among preschool participants exposed to the educational intervention involving ScratchJr. Notably, both instructional modalities appear commensurate in nurturing elementary computational tenets, namely modularity and control structures. The experimental cohort outperforms the control group with statistical significance in comprehending potent ideational constructs encompassing representation, algorithms, and hardware/software interplay. Conversely, the control group performs better in grasping the debugging concept than their experimental counterparts. The outcomes lend substantive credence to the efficacy of the distinct programming milieu offered by ScratchJr, underscoring its effectiveness in cultivating CT and coding proficiencies within the preschool demographic.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is crucial for students. Robot-supported learning has emerged as a popular approach for CT cultivation. To understand the effects of robot-supported CT cultivation, the current study conducted a meta-analysis to analyze studies from Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Science Direct databases (2012–2022) which screened using keywords ``computational thinking'' and ``robot''. After further screening, 26 peer-reviewed articles were selected. We synthesized the 33 effect sizes to assess the overall effectiveness of robot-supported learning on CT and its sub-dimensions: concepts, practices, and perspectives. Our findings revealed a medium effect of robot-supported learning on students' CT (g = 0.643), a large effect on CT concepts (g = 0.650), a medium effect on CT practices (g = 0.587), and a huge effect on CT perspectives (g = 1.419). We also explored the moderators (i.e., grade level, study duration, culture, learning strategy, and assessment tool) that might influence the effects of robot-supported CT cultivation. Moderator analyses indicated that short-term (less than four weeks) robot-supported learning had a larger effect (g = 0.901) on CT practice than long-term (more than eleven weeks) learning (g = 0.309). This meta-analysis indicates that educators could apply robot-supported learning to cultivate students' CT and concludes with related implications.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has gained increasing recognition as a 21st-century competency. Although initiatives have been taken to define the term for educational practices, limited empirical evidence is available to clarify its underlying components, especially at the primary education level. This study aimed to identify the associations between CT and specific cognitive skills in the primary school context. Based on the literature, three cognitive domains were studied (i.e., mathematical, visuospatial, and reasoning skills) and standard test batteries were applied to a sample of 633 primary students (aged 7–12 years). Linear regression analyses were performed with CT performance as the dependent variable to investigate its associations with the measured cognitive skills, and demographic features (i.e., age, gender) and coding learning experience (i.e., years of coding experience, extra-curricular coding experience) were included as control variables. The results indicated that the students’ CT performance was significantly predicted by their attainments in numeracy, visual perception, spatial visualisation, and inductive reasoning, and the results remained significant after controlling for demographics and coding experience. The study adds to the literature by enriching the understanding of CT as a psychological construct and has practical implications for educational stakeholders regarding the importance of interdisciplinary teaching and the integration of specific cognitive skills into CT learning activities.

AB  - The sustainable and digital future of work may imply a dramatic equilibrium change between social factors and technological ones. We argue that providing suitable tools to support End-User Development (EUD) in the workplace could represent a way to cope with such future changes. The contributions of this paper include the analysis and characterization of the most used EUD techniques and their crossover with a new conveyed model of Computational Thinking. The synthesis between these aspects is made explicit in the construct of EUDability, which is designed to capture the quality dimensions of EUD systems suitable to work scenarios where better roles and better tools for individuals may be shaped. EUDability has to do with identifying and assessing the difficulties of EUD techniques on one side and the Computational Thinking skills held by individuals on the other side.

AB  - There has been an increasing interest in the integration of technology into language education. Meanwhile, computational thinking (CT) skills are fostered which influence communicative language teaching and learning. Despite CT's established importance in science education, its significance in language teaching remains scarce. This study contributes to knowledge synthesis and methodological development by reviewing 16 journal articles, analyzing CT applications in language learning across educational contexts, intervention tools, CT skills, language acquisition, and assessment methods. The results indicate that (a) more CT-involved activities are needed for primary, secondary, and tertiary education, (b) educational robots and Scratch stand out as the most trending intervention tools, (c) CT skills such as decomposition, abstraction, generalization and so on have a positive effect on students’ foreign language acquisition, especially in grammar and writing, (d) assessment of CT development can be surveyed through a validated and reliable instrument such as computer programming self-efficacy scale or an online platform: Dr. Scratch; Conversely, there is a diversity of evaluation tools in foreign language learning. This study is the first to review experimental research on integrating computational thinking into foreign language learning and offers significant implications for future research.

AB  - The development of programming skills and computational thinking in the formal educational context is one of the most recent horizons set by many educational systems worldwide. Although the first computational thinking initiatives are being applied from the earliest school ages, this research focuses on the secondary education level. Specifically, the objective is the following: to analyse the implementation of Arduino, as well as the benefits and opportunities it brings to secondary school students. For this purpose, documentary research has been undertaken applying a systematic review according to the PRISMA 2020 framework following the PiCoS strategy. Atlas.ti 9 was used to analyse the information. Out of 316 papers identified, 37 were included in the research. In relation to the results, Arduino is primarily used in technology and physics subjects, although it is also used to develop interdisciplinary STEAM projects. As a rule, it is used to learn programming languages, but likewise as a resource to develop science experiments. LED lights, servomotors and breadboards are among the most commonly used resources together with the Arduino board. and Scratch was the most widely used software. The initiatives implemented have yielded both positive and negative results, for example, one drawback is that some projects are very difficult, and some achievements such as: increased motivation towards the contents addressed or also the development of some soft skills, such as problem solving.

AB  - Recently, virtual reality (VR) technology has shown great potential in advancing education with many pedagogical benefits for building the 21st-century teaching and learning experience. This study conducted a formative evaluation of an immersive VR expedition application with the aim of understanding users' learning processes and how the application facilitates higher education students' computational thinking skills. Six participants were randomly selected to conduct this evaluation. A mixed research approach consisting of quantitative and qualitative methods was employed. The study quantitatively analyzed users' scores from gameplay to understand how the intervention supported computational thinking skills. Participants were also interviewed to collect data after playing the mini-games to investigate users' experiences. The study showcases players' computational thinking competency, assessed automatically during gameplay. Further, this study used inductive content analysis to demonstrate users' reactions to prototyped VR mini-games. The qualitative findings suggest that users found the VR mini-games interactive and immersive, which provided an opportunity to foster learners' computational thinking skills. The quantitative analysis revealed that student's computational thinking competency can be enhanced through consistent playing of the mini-games. Moreover, the expedition aspect of the VR game stimulated learners' curiosity, which sustained their learning progress. Furthermore, users gained new knowledge and found the mini-games educative. Nevertheless, several aspects of the VR mini-games need improvements, according to users' perceptions. This study contributes to the knowledge in terms of the affordances of VR in education research and provides relevant insights that can shape future studies, for example, the recent hype of metaverse in education.

AB  - Project-Based Learning (PBL) and Computational Thinking (CT), a teaching strategy and a problem-solving method, respectively, have been widely used in teaching and learning because of their educational advantages for students and teachers. However, studies of their integration into the teaching and learning process have been scarce, resulting in a lack of guidance for educators to implement such an approach that apply constructivism learning theory. This study aims to systematically review and identify appropriate frameworks, models, techniques and tools that could guide the successful implementation of PBL-CT. This study examined relevant articles published from 2017 to 2021 to highlight the gaps in the PBL-CT execution and map their backgrounds into a coherent taxonomy that could help guide the directions of future studies. As revealed, none of such articles explicitly explain any suitable PBL-CT frameworks or models. The study identified several common elements for the PBL-CT framework formulation, indicating scaffolding and inquiry are the most commonly applied techniques, with visual tools dominating the PBL-CT implementation. Most articles involved computing, followed by STEM, with a few originating from non-STEM fields. Several important implications could help educators develop an effective PBL-CT course design and provide some guidelines for future research. An effective PBL-CT integration enhances teaching and learning besides improving students' computational thinking skills. Thinking skills are critical 21st-century skills needed for students' success.

AB  - Computational thinking has become an integral component of curricula worldwide, necessitating teachers to develop this competence in their students. To effectively meet these curricular requirements, teachers themselves need a solid foundation of computational thinking content knowledge, which refers to the understanding and skills they possess in this area. However, despite widespread recognition of this need, few studies have rigorously examined teachers' content knowledge in this domain. Addressing this gap requires the development of high-quality measurement tools. This study details the development of an instrument, created as part of the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) 2023 in Flanders, to measure lower secondary school teachers' computational thinking content knowledge in a valid and reliable way. The article first outlines the construction process of the instrument, which involved close collaboration with experts in the field and drew upon the framework of Fraillon et al. (2023). Following this, the instrument's psychometric properties are presented, which include both item-level and overall instrument characteristics. These properties were evaluated using data from a sample of 352 participants, applying both Classical Test Theory and Item Response Theory. The final tool consists of sixteen multiple-choice and short constructed response questions. The results indicate favorable item and overall instrument characteristics, thereby affirming its potential to measure the intended construct in a valid and accurate way.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) skills help students both understand and utilize computing in various domains to cope with the challenges posed by the complex digital world. This study applied mind mapping to programming language instruction in a primary school, and explored the effects of mind mapping on students' CT skills when learning programming with Scratch as a programming tool. Two types of mind mapping, construct-by-self mind mapping (CBS-MM) and construct-on-scaffold mind mapping (COS-MM), were proposed to compare which type is more effective in terms of students' CT skills. Seventy-three public primary school fifth-grade students aged 10 to 11 participated in the study. The CBS group included 33 students learning with the CBS-MM instructional approach, while the COS group comprised 40 students learning with the COS-MM instructional approach. Data were obtained from nine topic Scratch programming assignments and pre- and post-CT skills surveys completed by the two groups. Paired sample t tests were used to analyze whether the two types of mind mapping approach could improve both groups' CT skills. One-way ANCOVA and one-way ANOVA were used to examine the difference in the two groups' CT skills. The results showed that both CBS-MM and COS-MM can improve students' CT skills; however, the COS group students could better improve their CT skills with the assistance of the COS-MM method compared with the CBS group students who learned with the CBS-MM method. The findings of this study can provide some enlightenment for relevant instructors to design instruction and implement programming teaching with different kinds of mind mapping support that facilitates students’ CT.

AB  - The specific mechanisms by which teachers and parents can provide culturally relevant opportunities for computational thinking for racially/ethnically and linguistically diverse groups of preschoolers remain unknown. Accordingly, the purpose of this research is to examine how PreK parent and teacher voice directed efforts to realize a culturally relevant computing program. We drew data sources from a subsample of design-based research meetings in which partners collaborated to co-develop the first iteration of the program. Using qualitative analysis, we examined how parent voice and teacher voice, conceptualized as perspectives and participation, influenced theories of culturally responsive computing and computational thinking in early childhood education and the translation of theory into practice in classroom and home settings. Findings showed that connecting powerful ideas from computational thinking, namely algorithms and problem solving (e.g., debugging), to familiar activities and experiences served as a powerful entry point. Yet, differences arose in how teachers and parents conceptualized culturally relevant computing and made connections to familiar routines. We discuss what can be learned from parent voice in regards to bolstering children's self-expression, access to increasingly complex computational thinking tasks, and opportunities for learning cultural and community values through computing.

AB  - In recent years, the development of computational thinking (CT) has become integral to many school curricula worldwide. This has been associated with calls for computational thinking to be considered a ‘21St Century’ competency, valuable to all students as a transferable process for solving problems and building understanding of human behaviour and systems. However, while computational thinking is a focus of most secondary school computer science curricula, proponents such as Jeanette Wing argue its relevance for younger students, indicating more work must be done investigating its development in early years' education. This study used a structured, problem-based curriculum supported by guided inquiry pedagogy, to explore 6 year old students' learning of basic computational thinking concepts and practices while coding programmable floor robots (Blue-bots and an iPad app). Results indicated improvement across the seven lessons in students' sequencing/algorithm authoring, error correction, and pattern recognition. Furthermore, they revealed evidence of higher order thinking such as identifying patterns in code, and how these can be transferred to help solve problems of different designs. While currently play-based approaches are used to introduce computational thinking concepts and practices in early years' education, results from this study suggest that more structured, problem-based methods should be seriously considered. Results challenge commonly understood developmental theories about what young children can and can't do, contextualised within the field of computer science, and hold implications for early years' teachers' professional knowledge and pedagogy if they are to promote their students' learning in this increasingly important area. Given rapid technological advancements such as artificial intelligence (AI) and increasingly earlier exposure of young children to digitally-mediated information, this study provides support for the earlier and more systematic introduction of basic digital literacy knowledge and skills in early years' education.

In this study, we investigated the robots used, proposed activities, and evaluation processes. We also analyzed research contexts and the stated motivations to conduct the studies. Our review identified characteristics of the robots, such as input and output interfaces, cost, and availability. We also categorized activities considering context, modality of work, type of activities, duration, adults’ role, scaffolding, unplugged activities, explicit debugging, communication and sharing instances, and teaching knowledge from other domains. We analyzed the computational thinking evaluation process looking at types of assessments, asset concepts, and research design. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of existing research, identifies existing gaps, and provides recommendations for future studies.

AB  - The integration of computational thinking (CT) into K-12 education offers substantial potential to improve digital literacy and deepen students’ understanding across various subject areas. By embedding computational procedures and solution-oriented approaches into traditional curricula, students can develop essential skills that are critical for thriving in an increasingly digital world. However, the effective integration of CT into subject-specific learning poses challenges for educators, largely due to a lack of training and experience in implementing interdisciplinary instructional strategies. This study explores the impact of integrating CT into K-12 education through diverse instructional approaches, including modelling, storytelling, and unplugged activities. The research examines how students' subject knowledge, CT concepts, and practices evolved under each CT integration practice, as well as their acceptance toward CT integrated lessons. The study was conducted in different subjects, including language arts, biology, and physics, and at different grade levels. The technology acceptance model was used as a theoretical framework to understand students' adoption towards the different integration practices. The study revealed that different CT integration practices yield varying impacts on students' attitudes, particularly in relation to their prior programming experiences. Namely, primary school students with prior programming experience display a higher behavioural intention due to a lack of early biases toward programming. Conversely, secondary school students, less familiar with interdisciplinary approaches, initially show less enthusiasm for future engagement. These insights underscore the need for tailored instructional strategies that consider students' prior experiences and the broader goal of preparing them to contribute to a technologically driven society.

AB  - As we begin to identify essential skills for the future, there has been an increased focus on how to define and implement computational thinking within education. However, the question of how to engage children with coding activities within the context and limitations of the curriculum remains relatively explored. In our study, a human-centered design approach was followed to guide a small group of children through the co-design, implementation and evaluation of a board game. The board game had two versions: an offline version involving a robotic agent and an online version with its digital equivalent. A mixed-method approach was used to understand and compare levels of engagement, usability, and collaboration in both versions of the game. The tangible aspect of working with a robotic agent in the offline version led to greater levels of motivation and involvement with the game mechanics. Tangible robotics games tend to be more approachable for children. Our study shows that using such games by connecting the mathematics curriculum with coding problems can successfully engage participants in collaborative computational thinking activities. We contribute to the field by providing human-centered guidance for the creation of educational tools to develop computational thinking. Such guidance is not only applicable in technologically rich environments; it can also be applied in educational communities with limited access to technology.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has been relevant in teaching STEM courses, and educators are incorporating both plugged and unplugged CT activities in their modules to prepare new entrants for advanced knowledge. However, additional empirical data are needed to understand how an unplugged activities approach can lead to an improved understanding of CT concepts. Therefore, this study investigates the impact of unplugged activities on novice students' CT skills and unravels the characteristics of students' CT competency from performing unplugged activities. The experimental aspect of this study was conducted with a cohort of 210 students participating in an introductory programming course at a University in Nigeria. A mixed-method research approach and a quasi-experimental design were applied in this study to understand how the unplugged approach in teaching CT could help students improve their CT competency. A paired-sample t-test of familiarity score for each CT concept showed a significant increase in the score before and after the intervention. Furthermore, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was used for topic modeling of the text describing students’ solutions. Topic modeling allows for more insights into the steps taken by the students to solve CT problems. Only 27.62 % of students' solution descriptions contained CT concepts, 56.90 % of the students solved the puzzle with an optimal score, and 72.41 % of students who applied CT concepts of problem abstraction and decomposition were able to solve the puzzle correctly. Indeed, CT unplugged activities significantly increased the number of students who gained CT competency. In addition, this study provides recommendation for computer science educators and highlight future direction.

AB  - Computational thinking is a fundamental competence that is being introduced in K-12 and succeeding curricula worldwide. Despite this huge effort, many computational thinking models in the literature do not explicitly take into consideration the pupils’ age and the developmental nature of computational thinking skills. Furthermore, many existing computational thinking models are focused on the internal thinking processes of the individuals, failing to explicitly consider the situated nature, in terms of social context and artefactual environment, that usually characterise tasks that require computational thinking to be solved. In this paper, we present a framework for the design, realisation, analysis, and assessment of computational thinking activities, called CT-cube. The CT-cube allows to extend existing computational thinking models to consider the life-long development of computational thinking skills in individuals, from childhood to adult age, and to take into consideration the situated nature of computational thinking activities. We use the CT-cube to design an unplugged task, called Cross Array Task (CAT), allowing to assess the algorithmic skills of K-12 pupils and we show how the CT-cube can be used in this case to illustrate the development of this competence along the entire compulsory school path, considering a sample of 109 pupil aged 3 to 16 in Switzerland.

AB  - The current single teaching and assessing modes of English as a foreign language (EFL) grammar in China have caused the disconnect between grammar knowledge and competency with numerous errors in essay writing, somehow ignoring the analysis of learners thinking patterns. To solve the problem, computational thinking (CT), a higher-order thinking in solving problems and optimizing the way to acquire knowledge, was employed in the study. As needed, the experimental group was taught using the CT teaching model following CT principal elements (data analysis, pattern recognition, abstraction, decomposition, and parallelization), while the control group followed the traditional teaching mode. Quantitative and qualitative data were obtained based on the pre-test-post-test, classroom observation, and questionnaire survey. The results show that the grammar application in short essay writing of all the members of the experimental group significantly improved and that higher grammar learning agency and engagement were unfolded to show the changes of thinking patterns. However, not all the members from the control group showed similar results. CT serves as an important social mediation tool in EFL teaching. This study further enriches the teaching modes of grammar and is an effective attempt at introducing CT into learners’ thinking patterns.

AB  - With growing interest in supporting the development of computational thinking (CT) in early childhood, there is also need for new assessments that serve multiple purposes and uses. In particular, there is a need to understand the design of formative assessments that can be used during classroom instruction to provide feedback to teachers and children in real-time. In this paper, we report on an empirical study and advance a new unit of observational analysis for formative assessment that we call an indicator of a knowledge refinement opportunity or as a shorthand, KRO indicators. We put forth a new framework for conceptualizing the design of formative assessments that builds on the Evidence Centered Design framework but centers identification and analysis of indicators of knowledge refinement opportunities. We illustrate a number of key indicators through empirical examples drawn from video recordings of Kindergarten classroom lessons.

AB  - Interest in coding education has exploded in the past five years, especially in elementary and early secondary education. Teachers who are largely new to coding are expected to guide entire student bodies through the fundamentals of coding and computational thinking. But little is known about which coding and computational thinking (CT) concepts teachers feel most comfortable with and which concepts they struggle with. This study describes 127 elementary coding teachers’ changes in their beliefs about teaching coding and CT as they participated in year-long continuous professional development. Novice elementary coding teachers demonstrated most growth in their self-efficacy for teaching sequences, algorithms and loops. They were less secure in their knowledge of conditionals, variables, and functions. For computational thinking, teachers were most confident in their ability to identify patterns, think algorithmically, understand logic, and evaluate outcomes, showing less growth with decomposition and abstraction.

AB  - This study compares the effects of coding education with educational robot and unplugged coding activities on pre-school students' computational thinking and executive function skills. This study used a pre-test and post-test comparison group quasi-experimental design. The study was conducted in a public kindergarten with 48 pre-school students (24 educational robot- BeeBot® group and 24-unplugged coding group) aged 5-6. The TechCheck-K test was used to measure computational thinking skills, and Executive Functions Battery-Computerized Touch was used to measure executive function skills. The process started with pre-test applications and ended with post-tests after four weeks (16 different sessions) of the implementation in both groups. The study found a statistically significant difference between the computational thinking pre-test and post-test scores of pre-school students in both groups in favor of the post-test. It was determined that there was a statistically significant difference in favor of the educational robot group between the post-test scores of computational thinking skills. In addition, when the findings regarding executive functions were evaluated, there was a statistically significant difference between the pre-test and post-test scores of total executive function in favor of the post-test in both groups. However, it was observed that there was no statistically significant difference between the post-test scores of both groups in terms of total executive function skills scores. In addition, when the post-test scores of pre-school students in two groups were evaluated, it was determined that there was no significant difference in computational thinking and executive function skills according to gender. Consequently, it was determined that coding education with an educational robot was more effective for gaining computational thinking skills than unplugged coding activities for pre-school students. However, it was observed that there was no difference between the two groups in terms of the development of executive function skills in pre-school education.

AB  - Since environmental and energy issues and challenges continues to emerge as key global concerns, Green Building Certification Systems are becoming increasingly relevant in the construction industry. In this regard, LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is considered one of the most widely recognized environmental assessment methods used globally in the construction industry today. However, due to the high level of complexity of the LEED system, the tools usually used to verify the achievement of the credits lack of “design friendliness” and hardly communicate effectively with the conventional tools used by architects and engineers (e.g. CAD, BIM). This makes difficult to fully take into account, especially at the early design stage, the many interconnected aspects that contribute to the green certification, with consequent issues often arising in the design validation and/or construction phases, resulting in time delays and cost increments. The application of innovative problem-solving methods, such as computational thinking, together with coding techniques, represents an effective way to deal with this issue. This kind of methodology, in fact, allows the requirements of a specific LEED credit to be digitally parametrised and flexibly incorporated into a “designer friendly” working environment. In particular, Visual Programming Languages (VPLs), due to their high simplicity of usage, allow architects and engineers to develop algorithms and thus implement their technical knowledge in the field of environmental design with computer programming skills, useful to improve their tools and keep them constantly updated. The aim of this paper is to illustrate a methodology through which, by merging computational thinking strategies with VPL tools, is possible to keep under control, in the same working environment, all the parameters required to verify in real time the achievement of LEED credits. To demonstrate the flexibility of the approach, dedicated tools developed for the verification of some specific credits at different scales – neighbourhood and building – are illustrated as operational examples of the proposed methodology.

AB  - Computational thinking, defined by Wing (2011) as the “thought processes involved in formulating problems … so that the solutions are represented in a form that can effectively be carried out by an information-processing agent,” has become the central construct of K12 computing education around the world. This article provides a history of computational thinking, a summary of computational thinking's role in educational policy and practice, role as a research construct, and concludes by considering the future of computational thinking. The debate over how to define and teach computational thinking can be understood as a proxy for the broader questions about education.

AB  - Collecting and organizing data to understand and answer real-world questions is an increasingly important skill in our current world. Fostering data collection and analysis (DCA) skills in young children leverages key mathematics skills as well as the data representation, visualization, and interpretation skills of computational thinking (CT), culminating in a problem-solving approach with data. As such, the intervention, comprising investigations and a digital app, supported preschool teachers and children to answer data-focused questions by engaging in each step of the DCA process in order to foster CT and math skills. Teachers appreciated that the app offers a new way for children to visualize data and noted that the app provided learning opportunities for children that would not otherwise be possible or easy to implement. Results also suggest that the app provides a systematic process for data collection, entry, and interpretation. Children in classrooms that completed the intervention had significantly higher scores at post-intervention compared to children in classrooms that did not complete the intervention, controlling for pre-intervention scores, B(SE) = 0.13(0.05), t (6) = 2.48, p = .048.

AB  - Computational Thinking (CT), the conceptual foundations required for solving complex problems effectively and efficiently, is an imperative skill for today's learners, across disciplines and across ages. As for its importance in the wide network of digital literacies, CT has been implemented in various educational contexts, however mostly via digital artifacts, specifically in programming-related activities. This approach does not fulfill the potential of such integration for promoting learning. In this paper, we argue that digital literacies should not be bound to the digital realm, and present a novel approach to fully integrate CT into learning and teaching by the development of CT-infused “unplugged” pedagogical tools that are fully embedded in the subject matter. We demonstrate the advantages to student learning of these tools in two case studies from K-12 mathematics education: 1) An assistive tool for function investigation in high-school calculus – in this case, we point out to how CT skills that were implemented in the tool promoted students' problem solving; 2) A teaching unit for pattern sequences in elementary school – in this case, we show how students in the CT research group outperformed students in the other groups, and how they implemented CT to solve pattern sequence problems effectively and efficiently. We highlight that besides enhancing learning, this approach can help address the important issue of equity in education, and suggest ways to promote it via dedicated professional development.

AB  - Creativity and Computational Thinking (CT) have been pointed out as two important skills that would promote students in the digital age as contributing members of society. Therefore, these two constructs have been extensively researched in recent years, but the associations between them are yet to be fully understood. This study takes another step towards bridging this gap by examining the association between CT and three types of creativity, i.e., Figural Creative Thinking, Verbal Creative Thinking, and Computational Creativity. Data was collected from 119 ninth-grade students (14–15 years old) from Israel. Students took two commonly used creativity tests (Torrance's Test of Creative Thinking, and the Alternative Uses Test). They also used Kodetu—an online learning environment for CT—and we used the system log files to measure their CT acquirement and their computational creativity. Findings suggest some nuanced associations between the four sets of variables. Specifically, we point out the limited associations between verbal and figural creativities, some of which are negative; also, we found that the associations between creative thinking and CT, as well as between creative thinking and computational creativity, differ by gender.

AB  - Many studies have demonstrated that Virtual Exchange (VE) for teaching languages can have a positive effect on learners' intercultural awareness or achievements. However, during this century, the teaching process has shifted from teaching with technology to solving problems with it. In this regard, pedagogical experts in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) have developed programming and robotics based on Computational Thinking skills (CTs), which have been regarded as the core of 21st-century skills. In the field of CALL, this skill has received very little attention. Accordingly, we have attempted to switch the process and outcome of language learning in VE. Thus, we developed the conceptual framework that integrated CTsCALL and Individual-technology-task-environment Fit (ITTEF). Having designed our VE tasks based on CTsCALL, we provided the opportunity for 92 Spanish language learners in our project to exchange language and culture with Cypriot and Irish students and solve VE tasks based on CTsCALL. The result of the symmetric phase of the study validated the five-dimensional structure of CTsCALL and the four-dimensional structures of ITTEF in VE and CALL. It also revealed that language learners, who focused on the key information rather than the details while solving language tasks, as well as recognizing the pattern of task solving and applying them to other tasks, found VE, and CTsCALL to be aligned with their current capabilities, learning environment, and problem-solving skills that mediated their intention to learn and exchange information in this context in the future. Furthermore, the asymmetrical part of the study revealed that sixteen solutions are available to shape language learners' continued intention to use VE by combining the components of CTsCALL and ITTEF. Thus, the study developed the CTsCALL questionnaire and its theory into CALL together with the Council of Europe's Common European Framework of Reference for Languages and recommended that CALL researchers and educators take a broader view of VE, as well as continuing to validate CTsCALL in other CALL disciplines to show that this skill belongs to CALL as well.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is gaining increasing attention from researchers and practitioners all over the world to empower children in the digital era. However, there is no consensus on which components of CT to teach beginning coders in early childhood education (ECE). To address this issue, we conducted a systematic review of 42 empirical studies focused on teaching and assessing CT in ECE. We analyzed the included studies with the three-dimensional CT framework proposed by Brennan and Resnick (2012) and demonstrated how this framework could be modified to fit the context of ECE. Based on this systematic review, we sorted out the CT components that were proven suitable for young children to learn by incorporating emerging components and removing components inappropriate for young children. We thus proposed a CT curriculum framework for ECE that covers CT concepts (i.e., control flow/structures, representation, and hardware/software), CT practices (i.e., algorithmic design, pattern recognition, abstraction, debugging, decomposition, iteration, and generalizing), and CT perspectives (i.e., expressing and creating, connecting, perseverance, and choices of conduct). This systematic review and its associated CT curriculum framework provide important theoretical contributions and practical implications for early childhood CT education.

AB  - In this paper, we review and meta-analyze the findings of experimental studies published between 2006 and 2022 that examined the effects of coding and programming interventions on children's core and higher order executive functions (response inhibition, working memory, cognitive flexibility, planning and problem solving). The systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to address three research questions: 1) Which executive functions are most impacted by the teaching of CT? 2) Which instructional modality (educational robotics/virtual coding/unplugged coding) is most effective in enhancing executive function skills in learners aged 4–16 years? and 3) Does the cognitive effectiveness of coding vary with children's age? A total of 19 studies with 1523 participants met the selection criteria for the systematic review. The meta-analysis included 11 of those studies. The results reveal beneficial effects of structured virtual and tangible coding (educational robotics) activities for preschoolers and first graders, and significant effects of more unstructured virtual coding activities (e.g., Scratch-based) for older students. A multivariate fixed-effects model meta-analysis shows that the teaching of coding significantly improves problem-solving with the highest effect (dppc2 = 0.89), but also planning (dppc2 = 0.36), and inhibition and working memory with lower effects (dppc2 = 0.17, dppc2 = 0.20).

AB  - In light of the increasing importance digital economy, the significance of computational thinking has grown exponentially, becoming imperative in both workplace and academic settings such as universities. This article addresses the critical need to comprehend the factors influencing the acceptance of computational thinking. The dataset introduces an extensive questionnaire comprising five constructs and 25 items, rooted in the extended Technology Acceptance Model. Notably, the model incorporates facilitating conditions and subjective norm, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding acceptance. Data collection involved 132 undergraduate university students sampled through purposive sampling, specifically targeting courses with a focus on computational thinking. The resulting dataset serves as a valuable resource for future research, offering detailed insights into the factors determining the acceptance of technology in educational contexts beyond mere thinking skills. Given the scarcity of research on technology acceptance in developing nations, this dataset holds particular significance, serving as a foundation for potential cross-cultural comparisons. The dataset contributes to the field by presenting a robust acceptance model, explaining 74.2 per cent of the variance in behavioural intention, 60.2 per cent in perceived usefulness, and 56.1 per cent in perceived ease of use. This high explanatory power positions the dataset as a superior resource for replication, benchmarking, and broader applicability in diverse contexts, thereby enhancing the understanding of computational thinking acceptance across different populations and settings. This dataset stands among the pioneering efforts to assess the novel covariance-based structural equation model algorithm within SmartPLS 4, presenting a valuable resource for future research employing the same mechanism.

AB  - This paper describes a study designed to investigate the promise of resources that support the development of computational thinking (CT) in preschool children. This study was the culmination of a collaborative research process between researchers and media developers of a home-based intervention that included media and hands-on activities created to support the development of young children's CT. The mixed-methods study included 108 families, each with a 4- or 5-year-old child. Families, who participated in the study at home for six weeks, were randomly assigned to an intervention group that viewed media and engaged with hands-on activities with a CT focus or a control group that viewed and engaged with non-STEM literacy content. Data collection consisted of parent surveys, parent interviews, and CT learning and pre-coding tasks to assess children's CT abilities. Results indicate that the learning intervention demonstrates promise in supporting parental understanding of CT. Experience with the intervention over the six weeks also appeared to cultivate some CT strategy use in children as evidenced by parental reports and performance on learning and pre-coding sequencing tasks.

AB  - This study characterizes the literature on teaching computational thinking (CT) to preschoolers aged 4 to 5 years. Previous research and published systematic studies have provided important contributions about CT teaching to elementary and high school children. However, to date, there is no systematic overview of CT education for preschoolers. For this reason, this systematic mapping synthesizes 82 studies on CT teaching, through the implementation and evaluation of tools and activities to teach, improve or measure the CT knowledge acquired by children. Furthermore, studies on courses or training offered to preschool teachers related to the teaching of CT were also considered. From the selected studies, the following information was collected: year of publication; recovery sources and databases; vehicles and places of publication; temporal delimitation of research, research approach, nature and research method; CT teaching approaches; tools used to teach CT and how they are classified according to their physical characteristics and, finally, participants and individuals responsible for the research. The results suggest an increase in the number of publications in recent years, revealing the interest of researchers in the topic. Furthermore, we observed a trend towards the use of physical artifacts and the use of the disconnected computing approach to teaching CT skills to preschool children. The results also exposed that preschool teachers have little autonomy in implementing CT teaching activities because those are mostly implemented by computer professionals (researchers, teachers, etc.). This is because preschool teachers are still discouraged from teaching computer and technology-related content to children, considering them complex and disconnected from basic curricula. However, when teachers are trained to teach CT, they become interested in the content and become more active during the teaching process. We argue for integrating CT-related content into education curricula and supporting preschool teachers to implement it autonomously in their classrooms.

AB  - This paper deals within a context where technology plays a pivotal role in education. In this sense, it is essential to highlight the emergence of new competencies and skills in education due to technological advancements. Legislative frameworks have been developed to incorporate digital literacy, access to robotics, and computational thinking, between others. Hence, this review and meta-analysis aim at identifying the influence of robotics activities on computational thinking through a PRISMA-guided review. The findings reveal that interventions conducted in early childhood education significantly impact computational thinking. Results also showcase that, despite perceived barriers related to technology accessibility, the presence of legislation and contexts prioritizing these competencies is more relevant than the digital access gap.

AB  - Since computational thinking is a high-level cognitive skill and its conceptual framework has not yet been clarified, the assessment of this skill is problematic. While there is no consensus in the literature about the components of computational thinking, the abstraction component is located at a point where opinions intersect. In addition, it is predicted that computer science unplugged activities will improve computational thinking, and there is limited research examining this effect. As a result, this research aims to demonstrate the alleged effects of computer science unplugged activities on abstraction skill which is considered the critical component of computational thinking. The study, which was planned with a mixed methods research design, lasted 8 weeks. Quantitative data were obtained from the abstraction skill test developed by the researchers, while qualitative data were obtained from observations and task- based interviews after each activity. Quantitative findings showed that computer science unplugged activities significantly improve abstraction skills and thus computational thinking. Qualitative findings not only revealed that developments in the six abstracting steps caused this significant difference but also identified abstracting steps where the effect of each activity was limited. Suggestions for organizing activities to improve these steps are given. Finally, suggestions are presented for the conceptual framework of computational thinking based on abstraction.

AB  - The healthy development of cognitive functions, including executive functions, has been shown to depend mainly on the experiences and learning opportunities of people, especially during childhood. Over the past few years, researchers have been studying the impacts of diverse types of interventions on children’s cognitive development in which computational thinking programs are a recent field. This pilot study evaluated the effect of computational thinking training based on the “Programming for Children” program on the executive functions of children aged 10 and 11 years: working memory, inhibition, and planning (N = 30). The results showed that children in the experimental group improved on tests of visuospatial working memory, cognitive inhibition, and sequential planning compared with the control group. However, tests of verbal working memory, memory strategy, and visual spatial planning did not show any observed changes. Although this was an exploratory study, and its findings should be interpreted cautiously due to the small sample size, the findings support the relevance and feasibility of conducting similar larger studies with larger samples.

AB  - Computational thinking has been promoted as an impactful 21st-century skillset that can be transferred to many other disciplines and problem scenarios. With the proliferation of age-appropriate coding platforms for young children, computational thinking has become increasingly popular in early childhood settings. However, there is a lack of research on introducing coding and computational thinking to teacher training in early childhood education. To empower early childhood teachers in the digital society, this study introduced 17 early childhood teachers to robot programming and computational thinking through the ‘CT4ECE’ professional development program, which includes three phases: Learn, Practice, and Reflect & Improve. Results of pre- and post-intervention surveys revealed that the CT4ECE program significantly enhanced teachers' robotics and pedagogical knowledge, as well as their attitudes towards computational thinking, especially their interest in and their view of using computational thinking in classroom practice. Post-intervention interviews indicated that participation in CT4ECE helped educators gain a basic understanding of both coding robots and computational thinking suitable for young children due to a structured change process for teachers' professional learning. This study establishes a strong foundation for enhancing and expanding the CT4ECE program, ultimately equipping teachers and children with the necessary skillsets to thrive in the digital future.

AB  - The purpose of the current study is to investigate the effects of the unplugged computational thinking (CT) integrated STEM (UCT-STEM) approach and STEM approach on early childhood pre-service teachers’ CT skills (creativity, algorithmic thinking, critical thinking, problem solving, cooperativity, communication). The study was conducted with a total of 70 early childhood pre-service teachers. Quasi-experimental design was used; activities based on the UCT-STEM approach were administered to the experimental group and activities based on the STEM approach were administered to the control group. Post-test scores for CT skills showed a statistically significant difference in favour of the experimental group. It was concluded that the UCT-STEM approach was more effective in developing the pre-service teachers’ CT skills than the STEM approach. The current study presents an important finding to the literature in terms of the developed STEM and UCT-STEM contents and how these contents improve pre-service teachers’ CT skills. The STEM and UCT-STEM content provides significant information in terms of teacher practices. At the same time, this study offers important implications for program developers and policy-makers to integrate these innovative educational approaches into both early childhood education and teacher education programs.

AB  - The integration of computational thinking (CT) to enhance creativity in design students has often been underexplored in design education. While design thinking has traditionally been the cornerstone of university design pedagogy and remains essential, the increasing role of digital tools and artificial intelligence in modern design practices presents new opportunities for innovation. By introducing CT alongside design thinking, students can expand their creative toolkit and engage with emerging technologies more effectively. Although many design students may have limited experience with programming, incorporating accessible, no-code tools can help them confidently embrace computational methods, unlocking new pathways for creative exploration and innovation. This study proposes an alternative approach to improve the motivation of design students by introducing machine learning tools into product design processes. We developed an experimental pedagogy in which 56 industrial design university students learned how to use Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (Weka), a machine learning tool, for three hours of design work a week, for a total of eight weeks. Our covariate analysis of data collected in the pretest and posttest shows that the general learning motivations in the group using Weka are significantly higher than those in the group without Weka. However, no significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of learning strategies, collaboration, or critical thinking. Students using Weka spent more time focusing on model training and tended to improve their algorithmic thinking, and the introduction of Weka appeared to enhance their motivation to learn. On the other hand, these students might have been focusing on working individually at their computers, potentially neglecting communication and collaboration. The findings suggest that teaching machine learning applications without requiring coding has the potential to boost design students' motivation to engage with CT skills, though care must be taken to maintain collaborative practices.

AB  - There is increasing effort to integrate Computational Thinking (CT) curricula across all education levels. Therefore, research on CT assessment has lately progressed towards developing and validating reliable CT assessment tools, which are crucial for evaluating students' potential learning progress and thus the effectiveness of suggested curricular programs. Several CT assessment tools were developed for elementary, high-school, and university students over the last years. Moreover, associations between CT scores and other cognitive abilities were unraveled. However, studies on the topic in primary school level are scarce. Like the general concept of intelligence, CT remains broadly defined as the ability to combine algorithmic operations to form complex solutions in order to solve problems effectively, utilizing concepts of computer science with or without the use of computers. In this study, we aimed at specifying a cognitive definition of CT, focusing on the under-investigated population of primary school children. Since validated assessment tools for this age group were not available, we adapted a validated CT test, which was initially designed for middle school students. In our study participated 192 third and fourth graders. The analyses revealed promising results on the reliability of the adapted CT assessment for primary school students. Moreover, findings indicated CT's positive associations with i. complex numerical abilities, ii. verbal reasoning abilities, and iii. non-verbal visuospatial abilities. Our results indicate similarities but also differences in associations of CT with other cognitive abilities in primary school children compared to other age groups. In summary: i. numerical abilities seem to associate with CT at the primary school level, whereas this seems not the case later on in education, ii. verbal abilities seem to associate with CT both along primary and secondary education levels, and iii. non-verbal reasoning abilities seem to associate with CT from primary education level to the university level and beyond. These differences imply that several basic cognitive abilities support CT abilities and CT development differentially across ages.

AB  - The concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI), born as the possibility of simulating the human brain's learning capabilities, quickly evolves into one of the educational technology concepts that provide tools for students to better themselves in a plethora of areas. Unlike the previous educational technology iterations, which are limited to instrumental use for providing platforms to build learning applications, AI has proposed a unique education laboratory by enabling students to explore an instrument that functions as a dynamic system of computational concepts. However, the extent of the implications of AI adaptation in modern education is yet to be explored. Motivated to fill the literature gap and to consider the emerging significance of AI in education, this paper aims to analyze the possible intertwined relationship between students’ intrinsic motivation for learning Artificial Intelligence during the COVID-19 pandemic; the relationship between students’ computational thinking and understanding of AI concepts; and the underlying dynamic relation, if existing, between AI and computational thinking building efforts. To investigate the mentioned relationships, the present empirical study employs mediation analysis based upon collected 137 survey data from Universidad Politécnica de Madrid students in the Institute for Educational Science and the School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering during the first quarter of 2022. Findings show that intrinsic motivation mediates the relationship between perceived Artificial Intelligence learning and computational thinking. Also, the research indicates that intrinsic motivation has a significant relationship with computational thinking and perceived Artificial Intelligence learning.

AB  - Computational thinking is widely recognized as an essential skill for adapting to the current era, with programming learning being the most effective means to develop it. It is recommended that computational thinking and learning programming be introduced as early as elementary school. However, elementary school students often possess limited prior knowledge of programming, posing challenges in their learning process. The graphic organizers (GOs) may serve as a bridge between students’ existing knowledge and new learning, facilitating a deeper processing of the overall information and thereby enhancing the learning process. This can be particularly advantageous for early-stage learners when grappling with difficult subjects. Consequently, this study employed GOs to assist elementary school students in their computational thinking and programming learning, employing a quasi-experiment design to evaluate their effectiveness. The results showed that although all students demonstrated awareness of applying computational thinking to solve problems, those exposed to GO-based instruction exhibited higher levels of computational thinking, programming skills, and flow experiences.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) practices is a critical cognitive tool for students to overcome challenges in this technological era. Few studies investigated CT practices from a development perspective. A two-year intervention was implemented in 30 intervention and 22 control schools in Hong Kong to promote CT education (T1baseline: N = 13,056; T2: N = 16,367; and T3: N = 15,269). Senior primary students (grades 4 to 6) around 8–12 years old were targeted. Among them, 34% were girls at T1baseline. Their learning progression of cognitive development was assessed with a CT practices test. Data were analyzed using item response analysis. Learning trajectories of CT practices were modeled to understand how students’ cognitive development differed between schools. Insights of findings were discussed in bringing CT practices to life.

AB  - Engagement is critical to computational thinking and programming education. However, as multi-dimensional variables, when analyzing how different aspects of engagement in computational thinking tasks influence skills development, it becomes crucial to discern precisely which engagement components intersect with the progression of computational thinking skills. This discernment is pivotal because engagement can vary based on the task nature, the context, and the individual's preferences. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the gender differences in engagement and computational thinking skills and the predictive relationships among these sub-dimensions for boys and girls in an unplugged environment. In this study, a quasi-experiment for 90 sixth-grade students from a north Chinese primary school was performed. By partial least squares–structural equation modeling, students’ models of computational thinking skills and engagement were analyzed, and comparisons of boys and girls were made by analysis of covariance statistics. Results indicated that compared with boys, girls reported higher computational thinking performance and more engagement in unplugged contexts. Furthermore, girls’ computational thinking skills were only predicted by their cognitive engagement, whereas boys’ computational thinking skills were predicted by their behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement. Teachers can adopt these findings to design computational thinking teaching interventions that combine the advantages of unplugged activity and focus on the engagement of boys and girls.

AB  - In this work, we argue for expanding the scope of K-12 computational thinking (CT) integration contexts to include everyday scenarios involving moral reasoning. Epistemic overlap between computational thinking practices and moral reasoning suggest that these contexts are potentially rich sites to see “seeds of CT” in children's reasoning and can provide rich educational pathways for children into CT. Taking a case-study approach, we examine the reasoning of a second-grader, Ollie, on a task involving fair allocation of resources to victims of a natural disaster. Our analysis finds that Ollie's reasoning was rich with seeds of CT (e.g., problem formulation, abstraction, complex-systems thinking) and that empathy served as an important supporting role to the CT. This work has implications for curricular design, suggesting that fairness and resource allocation scenarios with built-in opportunities for empathy might provide rich sandboxes for CT integration.
